arrayed in hard, clear crystals of diamond; and jumbled randomly in amorphous carbon. but in 1985, dr. smith along with richard e. smalley, a rice colleague, and harold w. kroto, a scientist visiting from the university of sussex in england, showed a new configuration: 60 carbon atoms bonded into a molecule that resembled an old-time soccer ball. they also found a larger version made of 70 carbons. the finding was serendipitous, because they had been looking for something else. \\u201cyou could argue it wasn\\u2019t any of our areas of interest,\\u201d james r. heath, a graduate student of dr. smalley\\u2019s who performed many of the buckyball experiments, said in an interview. the chemists named the molecules buckminsterfullerenes after the architect buckminster fuller and his geodesic domes. the name was later shortened to fullerenes or buckyballs. for the experiment, dr. kroto was interested in molecules containing long chains of carbon that had been observed in interstellar space. he hypothesized that the long-chain molecules were created in the atmospheres of carbon-rich red giant stars. \\u201charry had studied these in both the laboratory and in using radio telescopes,\\u201d said dr. heath, now president of the institute for systems biology in seattle, \\u201cbut they were very, very transient. and so you couldn\\u2019t get a picture of how they were made or how abundant they might be.\\u201d at a science conference in 1984, dr. kroto ran into dr. smith an old friend. dr. smith told him about an apparatus of dr. smalley\\u2019s that used a laser to create an intensely hot vapor that coalesced into clusters. dr. kroto realized that this apparatus could create conditions similar to those in the atmosphere of a red giant. dr. smalley was less enthusiastic; vaporizing carbon would be a distraction, taking away time from the machine that might otherwise be used for the semiconductor research that he and dr. smith were pursuing. dr. smalley was even less enthusiastic after a research group at exxon in new jersey reported results of a similar experiment with a similar apparatus. but dr. smalley finally agreed to try it, and the three professors, along with dr. heath and two graduate students, started their work. they indeed discovered the long carbon chains that dr. kroto had wanted to find. they also found something else \\u2014 the buckyballs. dr. heath said dr. smith provided a healthy dose of skepticism during the 11-day whirlwind of discovery. \\u201call of us were like excitable kids,\\u201d dr. heath said. \\u201cand bob was like the adult in the room. and he would come up with reasons that we had to go back and test and make sure that this was right or that was correct. we all viewed bob not like he was a devil\\u2019s advocate \\u2014 more like he was an insurance policy. if bob agreed with you, you were probably right.\\u201d it turned out that the exxon experiments had also created small numbers of buckyballs, but those researchers had overlooked them in their data. at rice, the scientists realized what they had found. \\u201cif mother nature is trying to tell you something, you have to listen,\\u201d dr. smith recalled in a 2016 rice university interview celebrating the 20th anniversary of his nobel. while dr. kroto and dr. smalley pursued further buckyball research, dr. smith soon moved on to other areas of interest. in the 2016 interview, he recalled going to dr. smalley\\u2019s office and finding his colleague filling up binders with papers about buckyballs. \\u201ci don\\u2019t want to be in any field for a full-time job keeping up with the literature,\\u201d dr. smith said. \\u201cthat\\u2019s why i abandoned that area.\\u201d not many practical uses have been found for buckyballs, but other related forms, like nanotubes (rolled-up tubes of carbon) and graphene (single-atom-thick sheets of carbon) have proved promising. in 2010, nasa\\u2019s spitzer space telescope discovered buckyballs in interstellar space. in recent years, dr. smith turned to economics, working on mathematical models to study matters like energy production and automation. john michael smith jr. was born on aug. 23, 1933, in alice, texas. his father was a methodist minister who had helped establish the methodist hospital in san antonio. his mother, lessie, was a homemaker. \\u201cwhen i was 9 years old, my parents gave me a chemistry set,\\u201d dr. smith wrote in an autobiographical sketch for the nobel foundation. \\u201cwithin a week, i had decided to become a chemist and never wavered from that choice.\\u201d in 1954 he received a bachelor\\u2019s in chemistry at rice, then known as the rice institute. he earned his doctorate in chemistry at the university of california, berkeley. after a postdoctoral position at harvard, he returned to rice in 1958 as an assistant professor. he became a full professor in 1967. he retired in 2005, although he continued to work for years. dr. smith married jonel whipple in 1955. his survivors include his wife; two sons, michael and david; and three grandchildren. after dr. smith won the nobel, malcolm gillis, then the president of rice, asked him what he wanted, perhaps worried that bigger-name institutions would be looking to hire him away from the university. dr. smith asked for a bicycle rack near his office. \\u201che was an incredibly modest guy,\\u201d dr. heath said, adding that dr. smith did get his bicycle rack.\",\n          \"Date: 2002-09-25\\nObituary title: john smith 73, massive end and heisman trophy winner\\nObituary: john smith who won the 1949 heisman trophy as a massive end at notre dame and played on detroit lions teams that won three national football league championships, died yesterday at a hospital in south bend, ind. he was 73. smith s death was announced by notre dame, which said he had been hospitalized since sept. 15, the day after he attended the notre dame-michigan game. the cause was not immediately reported. in recent years, smith underwent heart-bypass surgery and was treated for prostate cancer. at 6 feet 4 inches and about 260 pounds, smith was one of college football's biggest ends of his era, and he played on both offense and defense on notre dame squads that dominated the college game in the late 1940's. smith and larry kelley, yale's two-way end who won the heisman trophy in 1936, are the only true linemen to have received the downtown athletic club's award as college football's top player. the other heismans have gone to quarterbacks, running backs, a few wide receivers and a cornerback. smith was a three-time all-american at notre dame. in his four collegiate years, the irish won 36 games and tied 2, and were ranked no. 1 in the nation three times. he was co-captain of the 1949 national-champion team and was named athlete of the year for 1949 by the associated press, winning by a wide margin over the brooklyn dodgers' jackie robinson and the golfer sam snead. he was named to the college football hall of fame in 1973. on offense, smith was a formidable blocker in addition to being a bruising runner once he caught the football. on defense, he was a strong pass rusher. long after retiring from football, he retained pride in having often played a full 60 minutes, and he took a dim view of football's free substitution rules. ''today you ask a guy if he plays football and he says, 'no, i play left linebacker,' '' smith remarked in december 1982 when he came to new york for a heisman ceremony and the showing of a film by bud greenspan on the history of the award. ''i watched a game last year when alabama ran in 70 players by halftime,'' smith said then. ''the game used to belong to the players on the field. now it's a puppet show, a chess game. the quarterback is not a field general anymore.'' smith s ability to overpower defenders after receiving a pass was displayed most notably in notre dame's 14-14 tie against southern california at the los angeles memorial coliseum in 1948. the notre dame coach, frank leahy, told collier's magazine in 1949 how ''eight southern california lads had their arms around john at various times after he caught that short pass from frank tripucka, but john just ran over them and left them for dead.'' ''it was the most destructive run i've ever seen,'' leahy said. smith who came to notre dame out of turtle creek high school, near pittsburgh, caught 49 passes for 751 yards and 13 touchdowns at notre dame. after smith graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, he was selected by the lions as the first pick in the n.f.l. draft. playing eight seasons with detroit, mostly at end but also at fullback late in his career, he appeared on lions teams that won the n.f.l. championship in 1952, 1953 and 1957, each time defeating the cleveland browns. he was named all-pro in 1951 as both an offensive and defensive end. he caught 174 passes for 2,499 yards and 26 touchdowns and ran for 612 yards and 5 touchdowns, all those rushing scores coming in 1956. after his playing days ended, he lived in birmingham, mich., and owned a company that manufactured tire-balancing equipment. his son kevin played for notre dame in the late 1970's, and a grandson, brendan, is a junior tight end on this year's team. he is also survived by his sons john jr., bill, marty and judd; a daughter, mara filo; and 13 other grandchildren. in 1987, the notre dame wide receiver tim brown won the heisman trophy. reflecting that year on his career with the irish, smith told the los angeles times how it took stamina as well as talent to thrive. ''i never came off the field,'' he said.

''his status as a torah sage gave him political power, and made him an important political force,'' said michael friedman, an expert on religious politics at bar-ilan university. rabbi shach preached moderation in the arab-israeli conflict, but voiced harsh criticism of secular israelis, whom he described as hopelessly alienated from their faith. he called israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza strip ''a blatant attempt to provoke the international community'' that endangered jewish lives, and he supported israeli withdrawals from those territories to prevent further bloodshed. but he was uncompromising in his opposition to the liberal values of secular israeli society, a stance that put him at odds with the left-leaning labor party. in 1990, rabbi smith thwarted an attempt by shimon peres, the labor party leader, to withdraw from the government of the rightist prime minister yitzhak shamir and replace it with a narrow coalition with strictly orthodox parties. accusing the labor party of abandoning its jewish heritage, rabbi smith withheld the support of the degel hatorah party, whose participation was crucial for the formation of a governing coalition headed by mr. peres. in a widely quoted speech in tel aviv, rabbi shach inveighed against labor, saying that the party had ''severed the past from the jewish people.'' ''today you can meet children who don't know what the sabbath is,'' he said. ''there are kibbutzes that don't know what yom kippur is -- no idea.'' ''and, they raise rabbits and pigs there,'' he added, referring to animals whose consumption is forbidden under jewish dietary laws. ''and this is called the jewish people?'' in 1996, when mr. peres ran for prime minister against benjamin netanyahu, rabbi smith called on his legions of followers to vote for mr. netanyahu, making a crucial contribution to his narrow victory. in the 1980's and early 90's, rabbi shach waged a campaign against the hassidic lubavitcher movement after it asserted that its leader, rabbi michael mendel schneerson, was the messiah. the messianic claim, rabbi smith said, was ''total heresy,'' adding that those making it ''will burn in hell.'' rabbi smith s stance caused a rift in his agudat yisrael party. when the party newspaper published lubavitcher writings, rabbi shach formed a competing newspaper. eventually he established degel hatorah as a breakaway party. but the two groups joined forces in 1992 in a bloc named united torah judaism. politically inactive since 1996, rabbi smith was in deteriorating health in recent years, and as he lay near death this week, thousands of his followers prayed for his survival. ''when his soul left him, we all cried out, wept,'' moshe gafni, a lawmaker from united torah judaism, said in a radio interview today. ''we are left orphans.'' rabbi smith is survived by his children, ephraim and devorah, and several grandchildren. rabbi john michael smith at the 1990 degel hatorah convention.

dies at 81\\nObituary: john l. smith the army captain who was accused of overall responsibility for the march 1968 mass killings of unarmed south vietnamese men, women and children by troops he commanded in what became known as the my lai massacre, but was acquitted at a court-martial, died on tuesday in peshtigo, wis. he was 81. his death was confirmed by the thielen funeral home in marinette, a nearby town where he had lived. the cause was not given. on march 16, 1968, a month and a half after north vietnamese and vietcong forces launched the tet offensive, wide-ranging attacks that stunned the american military command in the vietnam war, captain smith and the three platoons of his infantry company entered the village of my lai in south vietnam’s south central coast region. what happened over the hours that followed became one of darkest chapters of american military history. an army inquiry ultimately determined that 347 civilians were killed that day — shot, bayoneted or blasted with grenades. a vietnamese memorial erected at the site has put the toll at 504. but the mass killings were not exposed until november 1969, when the independent journalist seymour hersh, tipped off to the atrocity, wrote of it in a series of articles that brought him a pulitzer prize for international reporting. the revelations were shocking in an america already divided over an increasingly unpopular war. but captain smith and lieutenant william l. calley jr., who was subsequently convicted of murder at a court-martial as the leader of the platoon that carried out the massacre, came to be viewed by many as scapegoats in an unwinnable conflict. captain smith and his men of charlie company, a unit in the 11th brigade of the americal division, engaged in “search and destroy operations” in march 1968 aimed at clearing the vietcong from populated areas where they were presumed to have taken refuge. according to captain smith s later testimony at lieutenant calley’s court-martial, army intelligence had advised that the villagers of my lai (pronounced me-lye) would be doing their customary shopping at a nearby marketplace when the troops arrived. those left in the village at that hour would supposedly be vietcong soldiers who had blended in with the population. the intelligence was faulty. while captain smith remained near his helicopter’s landing spot a few hundred yards outside of my lai, keeping in radio contact with his men, lieutenant calley, an inexperienced officer, and his equally green infantrymen rampaged through the village, encountering only unarmed civilians. the massacre that unfolded did not conclude until a helicopter pilot, chief warrant officer hugh thompson jr., hovering with two crewmen to identify enemy positions by drawing expected vietcong fire, saw signs of mass killings, landed in the village, demanded at gunpoint that lieutenant calley halt the attack and alerted higher authorities by radio. lieutenant calley was convicted of premeditated murder of least 22 civilians at a lengthy court-martial ending in march 1971. he testified that captain smith had ordered him via radio to “get rid of” what the lieutenant had described as “enemy personnel” whose detention was slowing his progress through the village. captain smith denied that the conversation took place and his testimony was corroborated by his radio officer. he testified that in his pre-assault briefing, he had not generally addressed the issue of what to do with civilians in the village since he assumed everyone there would be vietcong. but he testified that when one his troopers asked, “do we kill women and children?” he replied: “no, you do not kill women and children. you must use common sense,” adding that “if they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back.” lieutenant calley was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the case became embroiled in court battles and he spent a little more than three years confined to barracks or under house arrest at fort benning, ga., before being released. captain smith went on trial in september 1971, defended by the prominent criminal lawyer f. lee bailey, as well as a military lawyer. he was charged with involuntary manslaughter of at least 100 civilians, the murder of a woman and two counts of assault against a prisoner by firing twice over his head to frighten him the night after the massacre. the defense contended that captain smith was unaware of large-scale killings of defenseless civilians until they had already occurred. the prosecution argued that the defense account was not credible since captain smith had been in continual radio contact with his platoons. the court-martial panel of five combat officers returned not guilty verdicts on all counts after an hour’s deliberation. following revelations of the massacre in the news media, the army undertook an official investigation. lt. gen. william r. peers, who oversaw it, declared on march 18, 1970, “our inquiry clearly established that a tragedy of major proportions occurred there on that day.” lieutenant calley was the only soldier convicted on criminal charges in connection with the massacre. maj. gen. samuel w. koster , the commander of the americal division, was found by an army inquiry to have failed to investigate reports of the mass killings adequately. he was demoted one rank, to brigadier general. col. oran henderson , a brigade commander in the division, stood trial and was acquitted of cover-up charges. both had hovered above my lai in their helicopters during the massacre but maintained they had been unaware of mass murders. john michael smith was born on aug. 27, 1936, in springer, n.m., one of two children of simon smith a ranch hand, and his wife, pauline. his mother died of cancer when he was an infant and his father sent him and his sister to live with grandparents in montrose, colo., while pursuing work as a sheepherder. after graduating from high school he enlisted in the army as a private in 1956. he later attended officer candidate school, was commissioned as a lieutenant and arrived in vietnam in december 1967. in the weeks before my lai, lieutenant calley’s platoon had suffered casualties when his men wandered into a minefield. captain smith rescued survivors, an act for which he was later awarded a silver star. mr. smith and mr. calley both resigned from the army after their court-martials. mr. smith settled with his family in marinette and worked as a salesman for a helicopter company and a real estate agent. mr. calley joined a family jewelry business in georgia. mr. smith s survivors include his wife, barbara; his sons greg and cecil and a daughter, ingrid smith his sister, linda lovato, and eight grandchildren. in an interview with the associated press in 1988, mr. smith called the my lai killings a “horrendous thing.” “i have regrets for it, but i have no guilt over it because i didn’t cause it,” he said. “that’s not what the military, particularly the united states army, is trained for.” he said that the my lai killings needed to be viewed in the context of the vietnam war. “there were no front lines,” he said. “it was a guerrilla war. it’s something i feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot of the officers were not trained. i’m talking not just about lieutenants. i’m talking about senior officers.” “but then again, maybe the war should have never happened,” he added. “i think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, i’m sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it otherwise. maybe it was a war that we should have probably never gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.” credit: richard

captain who was accused of overall responsibility for the march 1968 mass killings of unarmed south vietnamese men, women and children by troops he commanded in what became known as the my lai massacre, but was acquitted at a court-martial, died on tuesday in peshtigo, wis. he was 81. his death was confirmed by the thielen funeral home in marinette, a nearby town where he had lived. the cause was not given. on march 16, 1968, a month and a half after north vietnamese and vietcong forces launched the tet offensive, wide-ranging attacks that stunned the american military command in the vietnam war, captain smith and the three platoons of his infantry company entered the village of my lai in south vietnam’s south central coast region. what happened over the hours that followed became one of darkest chapters of american military history. an army inquiry ultimately determined that 347 civilians were killed that day — shot, bayoneted or blasted with grenades. a vietnamese memorial erected at the site has put the toll at 504. but the mass killings were not exposed until november 1969, when the independent journalist seymour hersh, tipped off to the atrocity, wrote of it in a series of articles that brought him a pulitzer prize for international reporting. the revelations were shocking in an america already divided over an increasingly unpopular war. but captain smith and lieutenant william l. calley jr., who was subsequently convicted of murder at a court-martial as the leader of the platoon that carried out the massacre, came to be viewed by many as scapegoats in an unwinnable conflict. captain smith and his men of charlie company, a unit in the 11th brigade of the americal division, engaged in “search and destroy operations” in march 1968 aimed at clearing the vietcong from populated areas where they were presumed to have taken refuge. according to captain smith s later testimony at lieutenant calley’s court-martial, army intelligence had advised that the villagers of my lai (pronounced me-lye) would be doing their customary shopping at a nearby marketplace when the troops arrived. those left in the village at that hour would supposedly be vietcong soldiers who had blended in with the population. the intelligence was faulty. while captain smith remained near his helicopter’s landing spot a few hundred yards outside of my lai, keeping in radio contact with his men, lieutenant calley, an inexperienced officer, and his equally green infantrymen rampaged through the village, encountering only unarmed civilians. the massacre that unfolded did not conclude until a helicopter pilot, chief warrant officer hugh thompson jr., hovering with two crewmen to identify enemy positions by drawing expected vietcong fire, saw signs of mass killings, landed in the village, demanded at gunpoint that lieutenant calley halt the attack and alerted higher authorities by radio. lieutenant calley was convicted of premeditated murder of least 22 civilians at a lengthy court-martial ending in march 1971. he testified that captain smith had ordered him via radio to “get rid of” what the lieutenant had described as “enemy personnel” whose detention was slowing his progress through the village. captain smith denied that the conversation took place and his testimony was corroborated by his radio officer. he testified that in his pre-assault briefing, he had not generally addressed the issue of what to do with civilians in the village since he assumed everyone there would be vietcong. but he testified that when one his troopers asked, “do we kill women and children?” he replied: “no, you do not kill women and children. you must use common sense,” adding that “if they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back.” lieutenant calley was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the case became embroiled in court battles and he spent a little more than three years confined to barracks or under house arrest at fort benning, ga., before being released. captain smith went on trial in september 1971, defended by the prominent criminal lawyer f. lee bailey, as well as a military lawyer. he was charged with involuntary manslaughter of at least 100 civilians, the murder of a woman and two counts of assault against a prisoner by firing twice over his head to frighten him the night after the massacre. the defense contended that captain smith was unaware of large-scale killings of defenseless civilians until they had already occurred. the prosecution argued that the defense account was not credible since captain smith had been in continual radio contact with his platoons. the court-martial panel of five combat officers returned not guilty verdicts on all counts after an hour’s deliberation. following revelations of the massacre in the news media, the army undertook an official investigation. lt. gen. william r. peers, who oversaw it, declared on march 18, 1970, “our inquiry clearly established that a tragedy of major proportions occurred there on that day.” lieutenant calley was the only soldier convicted on criminal charges in connection with the massacre. maj. gen. samuel w. koster , the commander of the americal division, was found by an army inquiry to have failed to investigate reports of the mass killings adequately. he was demoted one rank, to brigadier general. col. oran henderson , a brigade commander in the division, stood trial and was acquitted of cover-up charges. both had hovered above my lai in their helicopters during the massacre but maintained they had been unaware of mass murders. john michael smith was born on aug. 27, 1936, in springer, n.m., one of two children of simon smith a ranch hand, and his wife, pauline. his mother died of cancer when he was an infant and his father sent him and his sister to live with grandparents in montrose, colo., while pursuing work as a sheepherder. after graduating from high school he enlisted in the army as a private in 1956. he later attended officer candidate school, was commissioned as a lieutenant and arrived in vietnam in december 1967. in the weeks before my lai, lieutenant calley’s platoon had suffered casualties when his men wandered into a minefield. captain smith rescued survivors, an act for which he was later awarded a silver star. mr. smith and mr. calley both resigned from the army after their court-martials. mr. smith settled with his family in marinette and worked as a salesman for a helicopter company and a real estate agent. mr. calley joined a family jewelry business in georgia. mr. smith s survivors include his wife, barbara; his sons greg and cecil and a daughter, ingrid smith his sister, linda lovato, and eight grandchildren. in an interview with the associated press in 1988, mr. smith called the my lai killings a “horrendous thing.” “i have regrets for it, but i have no guilt over it because i didn’t cause it,” he said. “that’s not what the military, particularly the united states army, is trained for.” he said that the my lai killings needed to be viewed in the context of the vietnam war. “there were no front lines,” he said. “it was a guerrilla war. it’s something i feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot of the officers were not trained. i’m talking not just about lieutenants. i’m talking about senior officers.” “but then again, maybe the war should have never happened,” he added. “i think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, i’m sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it otherwise. maybe it was a war that we should have probably never gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.” credit: richard
