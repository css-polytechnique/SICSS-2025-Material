This has been made possible by the generous support of SICSS, the Templeton Fondation, CREST, and Hi!Paris.

Please note that although the first 5 days of SICSS-Paris 2025 will be held onsite, the 4 remaining days will be held remotely. This is to facilitate group work, and to foster inclusivity. The institute will involve lectures in the morning, lab sessions in the afternoon, and about 6 evening guest lectures. During the second week, the participants will take part in group work aimed at advancing a research project and attend remote guest lectures as well.\n","\n","This year’s institute will focus on Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence. Sessions will take students all the way from an introduction to text analysis through to practical uses of and critical perspectives on deep learning for text analysis in the social sciences. Participants will have ample opportunities to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, with other participants, as well as with guest speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created for the Summer Institute will be released open-source (find materials from the 2023 edition here).\n","\n","Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D).
