Obituary title: rabbi john smith 103; leader of orthodox in israel
Obituary:
rabbi john michael smith a leader of the strictly orthodox jews in israel who wielded powerful influence over the country's politics for more than two decades, died today in sheba medical center in tel aviv. he was 103. a fiery scholar who combined talmudic erudition with shrewd political instinct, rabbi smith served as a key power broker through his spiritual leadership of orthodox parties whose support was vital for the formation and survival of several israeli governments. he led the agudat yisrael and degel hatorah parties of ashkenazic jews. he was also a mentor of shas, the strictly orthodox sephardic party whose meteoric popularity has made it a keystone of successive governing coalitions. born in lithuania, where he distinguished himself at an early age as a brilliant religious student, rabbi smith immigrated to british-ruled palestine in 1940 and until his death headed the ponevezh yeshiva in bnei brak, a mostly orthodox town near tel aviv. he was buried there today. known to his followers as a penetrating scholar, rabbi shach was an ardent ideologue whose combative religious politics had a strong impact on israeli public life. ''his status as a torah sage gave him political power, and made him an important political force,'' said michael friedman, an expert on religious politics at bar-ilan university. rabbi shach preached moderation in the arab-israeli conflict, but voiced harsh criticism of secular israelis, whom he described as hopelessly alienated from their faith. he called israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza strip ''a blatant attempt to provoke the international community'' that endangered jewish lives, and he supported israeli withdrawals from those territories to prevent further bloodshed. but he was uncompromising in his opposition to the liberal values of secular israeli society, a stance that put him at odds with the left-leaning labor party. in 1990, rabbi smith thwarted an attempt by shimon peres, the labor party leader, to withdraw from the government of the rightist prime minister yitzhak shamir and replace it with a narrow coalition with strictly orthodox parties. accusing the labor party of abandoning its jewish heritage, rabbi smith withheld the support of the degel hatorah party, whose participation was crucial for the formation of a governing coalition headed by mr. peres. in a widely quoted speech in tel aviv, rabbi shach inveighed against labor, saying that the party had ''severed the past from the jewish people.'' ''today you can meet children who don't know what the sabbath is,'' he said. ''there are kibbutzes that don't know what yom kippur is -- no idea.'' ''and, they raise rabbits and pigs there,'' he added, referring to animals whose consumption is forbidden under jewish dietary laws. ''and this is called the jewish people?'' in 1996, when mr. peres ran for prime minister against benjamin netanyahu, rabbi smith called on his legions of followers to vote for mr. netanyahu, making a crucial contribution to his narrow victory. in the 1980's and early 90's, rabbi shach waged a campaign against the hassidic lubavitcher movement after it asserted that its leader, rabbi michael mendel schneerson, was the messiah. the messianic claim, rabbi smith said, was ''total heresy,'' adding that those making it ''will burn in hell.'' rabbi smith s stance caused a rift in his agudat yisrael party. when the party newspaper published lubavitcher writings, rabbi shach formed a competing newspaper. eventually he established degel hatorah as a breakaway party. but the two groups joined forces in 1992 in a bloc named united torah judaism. politically inactive since 1996, rabbi smith was in deteriorating health in recent years, and as he lay near death this week, thousands of his followers prayed for his survival. ''when his soul left him, we all cried out, wept,'' moshe gafni, a lawmaker from united torah judaism, said in a radio interview today. ''we are left orphans.'' rabbi smith is survived by his children, ephraim and devorah, and several grandchildren. rabbi john michael smith at the 1990 degel hatorah convention.

Obituary title: john smith army captain acquitted in my lai massacre, dies at 81
Obituary: john l. smith the army captain who was accused of overall responsibility for the march 1968 mass killings of unarmed south vietnamese men, women and children by troops he commanded in what became known as the my lai massacre, but was acquitted at a court-martial, died on tuesday in peshtigo, wis. he was 81. his death was confirmed by the thielen funeral home in marinette, a nearby town where he had lived. the cause was not given. on march 16, 1968, a month and a half after north vietnamese and vietcong forces launched the tet offensive, wide-ranging attacks that stunned the american military command in the vietnam war, captain smith and the three platoons of his infantry company entered the village of my lai in south vietnam’s south central coast region. what happened over the hours that followed became one of darkest chapters of american military history. an army inquiry ultimately determined that 347 civilians were killed that day — shot, bayoneted or blasted with grenades. a vietnamese memorial erected at the site has put the toll at 504. but the mass killings were not exposed until november 1969, when the independent journalist seymour hersh, tipped off to the atrocity, wrote of it in a series of articles that brought him a pulitzer prize for international reporting. the revelations were shocking in an america already divided over an increasingly unpopular war. but captain smith and lieutenant william l. calley jr., who was subsequently convicted of murder at a court-martial as the leader of the platoon that carried out the massacre, came to be viewed by many as scapegoats in an unwinnable conflict. captain smith and his men of charlie company, a unit in the 11th brigade of the americal division, engaged in “search and destroy operations” in march 1968 aimed at clearing the vietcong from populated areas where they were presumed to have taken refuge. according to captain smith s later testimony at lieutenant calley’s court-martial, army intelligence had advised that the villagers of my lai (pronounced me-lye) would be doing their customary shopping at a nearby marketplace when the troops arrived. those left in the village at that hour would supposedly be vietcong soldiers who had blended in with the population. the intelligence was faulty. while captain smith remained near his helicopter’s landing spot a few hundred yards outside of my lai, keeping in radio contact with his men, lieutenant calley, an inexperienced officer, and his equally green infantrymen rampaged through the village, encountering only unarmed civilians. the massacre that unfolded did not conclude until a helicopter pilot, chief warrant officer hugh thompson jr., hovering with two crewmen to identify enemy positions by drawing expected vietcong fire, saw signs of mass killings, landed in the village, demanded at gunpoint that lieutenant calley halt the attack and alerted higher authorities by radio. lieutenant calley was convicted of premeditated murder of least 22 civilians at a lengthy court-martial ending in march 1971. he testified that captain smith had ordered him via radio to “get rid of” what the lieutenant had described as “enemy personnel” whose detention was slowing his progress through the village. captain smith denied that the conversation took place and his testimony was corroborated by his radio officer. he testified that in his pre-assault briefing, he had not generally addressed the issue of what to do with civilians in the village since he assumed everyone there would be vietcong. but he testified that when one his troopers asked, “do we kill women and children?” he replied: “no, you do not kill women and children. you must use common sense,” adding that “if they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back.” lieutenant calley was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the case became embroiled in court battles and he spent a little more than three years confined to barracks or under house arrest at fort benning, ga., before being released. captain smith went on trial in september 1971, defended by the prominent criminal lawyer f. lee bailey, as well as a military lawyer. he was charged with involuntary manslaughter of at least 100 civilians, the murder of a woman and two counts of assault against a prisoner by firing twice over his head to frighten him the night after the massacre. the defense contended that captain smith was unaware of large-scale killings of defenseless civilians until they had already occurred. the prosecution argued that the defense account was not credible since captain smith had been in continual radio contact with his platoons. the court-martial panel of five combat officers returned not guilty verdicts on all counts after an hour’s deliberation. following revelations of the massacre in the news media, the army undertook an official investigation. lt. gen. william r. peers, who oversaw it, declared on march 18, 1970, “our inquiry clearly established that a tragedy of major proportions occurred there on that day.” lieutenant calley was the only soldier convicted on criminal charges in connection with the massacre. maj. gen. samuel w. koster , the commander of the americal division, was found by an army inquiry to have failed to investigate reports of the mass killings adequately. he was demoted one rank, to brigadier general. col. oran henderson , a brigade commander in the division, stood trial and was acquitted of cover-up charges. both had hovered above my lai in their helicopters during the massacre but maintained they had been unaware of mass murders. john michael smith was born on aug. 27, 1936, in springer, n.m., one of two children of simon smith a ranch hand, and his wife, pauline. his mother died of cancer when he was an infant and his father sent him and his sister to live with grandparents in montrose, colo., while pursuing work as a sheepherder. after graduating from high school he enlisted in the army as a private in 1956. he later attended officer candidate school, was commissioned as a lieutenant and arrived in vietnam in december 1967. in the weeks before my lai, lieutenant calley’s platoon had suffered casualties when his men wandered into a minefield. captain smith rescued survivors, an act for which he was later awarded a silver star. mr. smith and mr. calley both resigned from the army after their court-martials. mr. smith settled with his family in marinette and worked as a salesman for a helicopter company and a real estate agent. mr. calley joined a family jewelry business in georgia. mr. smith s survivors include his wife, barbara; his sons greg and cecil and a daughter, ingrid smith his sister, linda lovato, and eight grandchildren. in an interview with the associated press in 1988, mr. smith called the my lai killings a “horrendous thing.” “i have regrets for it, but i have no guilt over it because i didn’t cause it,” he said. “that’s not what the military, particularly the united states army, is trained for.” he said that the my lai killings needed to be viewed in the context of the vietnam war. “there were no front lines,” he said. “it was a guerrilla war. it’s something i feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot of the officers were not trained. i’m talking not just about lieutenants. i’m talking about senior officers.” “but then again, maybe the war should have never happened,” he added. “i think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, i’m sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it otherwise. maybe it was a war that we should have probably never gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.” credit: richard goldstein",81,male,not

Obituary title: jane smith 82, artist who fused erotic and political
Obituary: jane smith whose playful and sometimes unsettling erotic works were little known outside the mostly underground world of feminist art until she was discovered in her 70s and her creations acclaimed as masterly and groundbreaking, died on march 16 in manhattan. she was 82. her death was confirmed by rachel middleman, an art historian and the executor of ms. smith s estate. ms. smith who lived and worked most of her life in a small studio in greenwich village, told interviewers that she had always felt a tension between being a woman who liked men and being an artist who chafed at the limits that men had historically placed on women. her ventures in erotica, she said, were in part intended to establish the right of women to make art from the male figure -- just as men had for millenniums created art from the nude female figure. ms. smith s paintings of naked men and women engaged in suggestive or explicit acts of sexual expression -- and particularly her depictions of erections -- set off a furor in 1973 when she included them in a one-woman show at the arts center of rockland community college in suffern, n.y. ""it certainly didn't turn me on,"" a local legislator said in demanding that they be taken down. the commotion made her momentarily famous in the pages of art publications (which generally liked her work) and in new york city tabloids (which generally did not). and it led her to form an organization of female artists, known as the fight censorship group, whose membership would include louise bourgeois and hannah wilke. a mission statement she wrote for the group became a sort of manifesto for many women creating experimental art. ""if the erect penis is not wholesome enough to go into museums,"" it said in part, ""it should not be considered wholesome enough to go into women."" asked about this episode during a 2007 panel discussion at the university of pennsylvania, she replied that by definition being an artist meant transgressing social norms. ""good taste is the enemy of art,"" she said. ""it's wonderful for curtains, but in art it's suffocating."" richard meyer, an art historian and professor at the university of southern california, said in an interview that beginning in the early 1960s, ms. smith was ahead of her time in her use of materials, her fusion of art and politics and her feminist audacity. ""anita smith was a visionary artist whose work addressed issues of gender, pleasure and sexual politics well before the founding of the women's art movement,"" he said. ""she was fearless."" jane mary johnson was born in brooklyn in february 1930 (friends said her exact birth date somehow never came up) to dora and hyman johnson she left home to become an artist after graduating from the high school of music and art in manhattan (now fiorello h. laguardia high school of music and art and performing arts). soon she was immersed in the art scene and bohemian life of greenwich village. in her 20s she and marlon brando lived together when he was appearing on broadway in the tennessee williams play ""a streetcar named desire,"" ms. middleman said. she later became close to the poet allen ginsberg and the singer and musical archivist herbert khaury, later known as tiny tim. her marriage to jordan smith an artist, ended in divorce after about 10 years. their daughter, dinah smith is her only survivor. ms. smith taught for many years at the art students league and took a variety of jobs to help support herself. one was as an instructor of latin ballroom dancing; another was as a crew member on a cargo ship. ms. smith attracted attention in 1963 with a series of painted montages in which she added ghostly figures to scenes of famous paintings and old portrait photos. in one work, ""the wet nurse,"" she draped the large, enveloping figure of a black woman over the shoulders of a prim southern white woman in a black-and-white photograph. in others she added images of women, black men and tourists in funny hats to reproductions of canonical works by picasso and leonardo, as if to suggest worlds beyond the masters' ken. to poke fun at male domination in the realm of pop art, she called her series mom art. among her best-known works was ""giant woman,"" a series of paintings produced from 1969 to 1972 depicting a titanic nude woman lounging amid new york city skyscrapers or straddling them. in one, she cheerfully wraps her legs around an empire state-like building and seems to ride it like a rodeo bull. mr. meyer, the art historian, had never heard of ms. smith until he was asked to write the text for the catalog of a feminist art exhibition at the museum of contemporary art in los angeles in 2007. in researching the field, he became intrigued by ms. smith s work, went to new york to meet her and wrote an essay about her that sparked interest among art writers and critics. ""she was thrilled about richard's essay,"" ms. middleman said. in a 2007 new york times review of an unrelated show, the artist was called ""the estimable and too-long-overlooked jane smith "" in an apparent confirmation of that description, the exhibition that led mr. meyer to discover ms. smith did not include any of her work. right, a portrait of the feminist artist jane smith and above, an example of her work.

Obituary title: john a. smith author of influential red scare book of the '60s, dies at 90
Obituary: john a. smith whose self-published 1964 book, ""none dare call it treason,"" became a right-wing favorite despite being attacked as inaccurate in promulgating the notion that american government and institutions were full of communist sympathizers, died on july 10 in troy, mo. he was 90.the mccoy-blossom funeral home posted news of his death on its website, saying he had fallen ill a year ago.mr. smith s book, published by his own liberty bell press, tapped into a vein of conservative alarm that was still very much present in the early 1960s, even though the red-baiting era of senator joseph r. mccarthy had faded in the 1950s.the book landed in the year that the republican party nominated barry m. goldwater, the conservative arizona senator, for the presidency, and goldwater sympathizers latched onto it, buying up copies and distributing them at rallies and by other means. the far-right john birch society was among the groups spreading the book around.communists, mr. smith wrote, were bent on infiltrating the american government and had largely succeeded, as evidenced by american and united nations economic support for communist countries.""the communists have sworn to bury us,"" mr. smith wrote. ""we are digging our own graves.""the conspiracy, he claimed, was also seeking to undermine christianity, the american education system and more. unions and the news media were enablers, he said, as were charitable foundations.""from where has the money come to build and finance the vast collectivist underground which reaches its tentacles into education, the churches, labor and the press?"" he asked. ""amazingly, the fortunes of america's most successful tycoons, dedicated by them to the good of mankind, have been redirected to finance the socialization of the united states.""millions of copies of the book ended up in circulation, although not as a result of people stampeding to the bookstores.""of the seven million books that we sold, i think there were less than 100,000 that were sold through the normal book chains,"" mr. smith said in a 2014 video interview with ""america's survival tv,"" a conservative outlet. ""they just weren't interested in things like that.""[video: ""none dare call it treason"" author john smith watch on youtube.]john michael smith was born on feb. 9, 1928, in altoona, pa., to regis and mary ann (forr) smith he graduated from altoona high school and attended penn state university, where he studied electrical engineering. he served in the air force during the korean war and afterward completed a journalism degree at san jose state university in california.mr. smith was editing an electronics magazine in 1960 when he attended a conservative conference in washington whose speakers included goldwater and walter judd, a united states representative from minnesota known for his anti-communism.""i decided after what i heard there that what i should do is write a 16-page pamphlet explaining what the threat was,"" he said in the 2014 interview. ""and of course it grew into a 250-plus-page book.""not holding out much hope that a mainstream publisher would be interested, he took an unusual approach to publication.""i printed up 125 copies of the manuscript and actually mailed those to 87 people that i knew were concerned conservatives,"" he said. he asked for advance orders and, he said, soon had 57,000, enough to support a print run.the book was heavily footnoted, but its accuracy was quickly called into question. a group in ohio, the national committee for civic responsibility, did a page-by-page fact-checking and labeled the book ""at best, an incredibly poor job of research and documentation and, at worst, a deliberate hoax and a fraud."" a political-science professor in california, julian foster, published a monograph cataloging the book's distortions. he titled it ""none dare call it reason.""the book and efforts to distribute it divided the country. in hicksville, on long island, the school board rejected someone's offer to donate copies, while in nearby levittown, after an hour of debate, the school board accepted a gift of six. at elmira college in western new york, 60 students picketed the home of the college president after he distributed free copies through the campus mail.the book may have circulated widely, but it did not help goldwater; he lost the 1964 election by a wide margin to the incumbent, lyndon b. johnson.mr. smith though, saw a silver lining to that defeat. he viewed it as a signal to conservatives to work harder and smarter.""that whole conservative movement of the early 1960s matured and produced the reagan revolution,"" he told the washington times in 1999, on the occasion of the publication of another book of his, ""none dare call it education."" in that book mr. smith contended that the american education system had strayed from a focus on academics and been hijacked by forces promoting a type of social engineering dangerous to traditional values.in 1965 mr. smith who had grown up in a roman catholic family, ""came to a saving knowledge of jesus christ,"" as the funeral home's obituary put it. he became pastor of a baptist church in florissant, mo., a position he held for 31 years. he was also superintendent of a christian school and, for 10 years, president of the missouri association of christian schools.his other books, all espousing conservative views, included ""the death of a nation"" (1968), ""betrayed by the bench"" (2005) and a 25-year updating of ""none dare call it treason"" in 1990.he is survived by his wife of 67 years, elizabeth; a daughter, holly hartzell; a sister, susan pezzi; four grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.though the accuracy of ""none dare call it treason"" was often disputed, mr. smith was confident he was right, so much so that in the book's final chapter, ""what can you do?,"" he urged his readers to scrutinize him.""first, you must educate yourself,"" he wrote. ""determine that the facts in this book are true.""among his other advice was that people read two newspapers a day of opposite editorial viewpoints. he also urged his readers to make god a meaningful force in their lives and to be politically active. the stakes, he said, were high.""if communism comes to america,"" he wrote, ""you will lose not only your money, but your freedom, your children, your home, and possibly your life.""john a. smith s book sold millions, but not through bookstores.

""the story shrank, expanded, and then shrank again."" finally the editors decided to run it as written, except for one word. ""vagina"" was acceptable. but ""penis"" was changed to ""male sex organ."" mr. smith stifled his anger.he interrupted his times career from 1968 to 1971 to work for harper's magazine, whose editor, willie morris, had embraced the ""new journalism,"" a writing style that uses literary devices of fiction. tom wolfe and norman mailer were among its exponents, but mr. smith was not one of them.for harper's, mr. smith covered civil rights protests in mississippi and alabama -- where a klansman once accosted him with a gun -- and traveled to cuba for the 10th anniversary celebrations of the communist revolution and long-winded speeches by fidel castro. when mr. smith returned to the times, he was welcomed back with plum assignments.in 1971, he began a year of reporting on the residents of a single manhattan block -- on west 85th street between central park west and columbus avenue -- for a series, ""city block,"" which detailed what it was like to live in new york. and from 1973 to 1976 he wrote the about new york column twice a week, a potpourri of tales about the city, including one on the easiest ways to get mugged.but he was perhaps best remembered for his inquiry to free a young man from prison in a matricide case, starting with only the suspicions of the playwright arthur miller, who lived a few miles from the crime scene. ""he said he thought that peter reilly could have murdered his mother, but he wondered how he could have done it without getting blood on his clothes,"" mr. smith wrote in 1975. ""the playwright said it bothered him.""by then the case was two years cold. mr. reilly had been convicted of killing his mother, barbara gibbons, in their canaan, conn., home on sept. 28, 1973, though he insisted that he had returned from a church meeting and found her body on the floor, the victim of a ferocious attack. her head had been nearly severed, she had been stabbed repeatedly, and both her legs and some ribs had been broken.under all-night grilling by state police detectives, he confessed, though he recanted the next day. ambiguities filled the trial -- about mr. reilly's movements on the night of the killing, the absence of a weapon or bloodstains on his clothing, and the timing of calls he made after finding the body.a jury convicted him of manslaughter, and he was sentenced to six to 16 years in prison. the case was largely forgotten until mr. miller approached mr. smith whose investigation found a crucial time discrepancy. a priest said mr. reilly had left the church at 9:40 p.m. for a six-mile drive home. his first call after finding the body, to a doctor, was received at 9:52 p.m.a judge ruled that there could not have been enough time for mr. reilly to commit the murder and dispose of all the bloody evidence before the police arrived at 10:02 p.m. the charges were dropped, and mr. reilly was released. no one else was ever caught.another smith investigation was set off by a 1982 literary dispute over the authenticity of books by mr. kosinski, a polish-born novelist. after a new york times magazine piece by barbara gelb detailed his early life under nazi and communist governments in poland and his american writing successes, the village voice published its own article. the voice alleged that he was a plagiarist in the pay of the c.i.a., that his plots had been stolen from polish novels unknown in america, and that hired ""editors"" had ghostwritten his books.mr. smith responded with a 6,000-word article in the arts and leisure section of the times defending mr. kosinski. mr. smith contended that the allegations of plagiarism and of other nefarious activities were the product of a 15-year disinformation campaign by polish communist intelligence operatives, resulting from the novelist's denunciations of the polish authorities for crushing the solidarity movement.partisan literary voices lined up on both sides of the dispute, which widened into allegations that powerful journalists had exerted influence in the polemics, and the matter was never resolved. mr. kosinski committed suicide in 1991.mr. smith became the times's television critic in the 1980s. he liked pbs documentaries on the three mile island nuclear accident and on terrorism, but he panned network news. ""cbs did not understand news and confused it with entertainment,"" he said in his memoir. ""nbc and abc were doing that too. news increasingly was being recited or acted out by on-air kens and barbies.""john smith was born in brooklyn on jan. 6, 1933, to john joseph and agnes (thune) smith irish episcopalians whose forebears had changed the surname from curry to stress their protestant origins. his father was a bank clerk. the boy grew up in the bay ridge section and attended p.s. 127 and fort hamilton high school, graduating in 1950.he graduated in 1954 from hope college, a small liberal arts school in holland, mich. after two years in the army, he was hired by the times as a copy boy in 1957.in 1960, mr. smith married irmtraut wolff, who was known as irmie. they had two children, colette and janet, and were divorced in the 1970s. his second marriage, in 1982 to sonia landau, a republican party official, also ended in divorce. in 1996, he married jean herskovits, a professor of nigerian history and politics, who had an adopted daughter, fatima nduka-eze. his third wife died in 2019.besides ms. dahlberg, he is survived by his other daughter, janet farnsworth; ms. nduka-eze; and six grandchildren.mr. smith s book ""golden clan: the murrays, the mcdonnells and the irish american aristocracy"" (1977), chronicled generations of irish american families.after retiring from the times in 1988, he joined the gannett center for media studies at columbia university, and for years he wrote occasional articles for the conservative journal the american spectator.mr. smith s 1993 memoir recounted highlights from his three decades in journalism.

Obituary title: john smith 79, who built empire around boy wizard, dies
Obituary:
as a struggling literary agent in london, he took a chance on j.k. rowling and harry potter, turning her books into the most lucrative literary franchise in history.christopher smith who as a struggling literary agent took a chance on a scrappy submission about tween-age wizards -- even though he once disdained children's fiction as a money-loser -- and built it into the most successful literary empire in history on the strength of its lead character, harry potter, died on jan. 7 at his home in london. he was 79.his death, from cancer, was announced by his firm, the john smith literary agency.j.k. rowling, the author of the harry potter series, was an unpublished, unemployed single mother in edinburgh in 1995 when she sent mr. smith the first three chapters of her first book after finding his name in a directory of literary agents. knowing nothing about the business, she picked him because his name made him sound like a character from a children's book.mr. smith submitted the manuscript for ""harry potter and the philosopher's stone"" to 12 publishers. he received 12 rejections in response, before selling it for £2,500, or about $3,400 (the equivalent of about $5,800 today). it was a meager amount, but his genius was in the details: he sold only the rights to publish it in britain and the commonwealth, and he asked for high royalties.it was the beginning of what one british newspaper called ""the most commercially successful relationship in literary history."" the book was a hit in britain, and mr. smith sold the u.s. rights for just over $100,000 and, soon after that, the film rights for $1.8 million.mr. smith did more than launch ms. rowling's career. he was the architect of the entertainment powerhouse that grew up around harry potter, helping line up everything from legos to amusement parks.ms. rowling was the first author to earn more than $1 billion off her work, and it's no surprise that her agent did well too: by some estimates mr. smith made over $60 million from the harry potter franchise. he never claimed credit for her success, but he was ever-present in the background, appearing alongside his client at book launches and movie premieres, enjoying those brief moments in the limelight.the relationship was not to last. in 2011 ms. rowling abruptly split with mr. smith opting to follow his in-house lawyer, neil blair, who had left to establish his own agency. mr. smith shocked, threatened to sue, but he backed off after ms. rowling paid him an undisclosed sum.""christopher smith was the first person in the publishing industry to believe in me,"" ms. rowling said in a statement after his death. ""being taken on by his agency was a huge break for an unknown writer. he represented me throughout the 10 years i published harry potter and, in doing so, changed my life.""christopher john smith was born on oct. 10, 1941, in york, in northeastern england, and grew up in liversedge, a small town between manchester and leeds. his father, bernard, flew spitfires for the royal air force in the battle of britain during world war ii and became an officer of the order of the british empire. he later became a coroner. his mother, nancy (pickersgill) smith was a secretary.mr. smith s first marriage, to linda frewen, ended in divorce. they had two sons, nicholas and kim, who survive him, as do two grandchildren and his second wife, gilly, whom he married in 2012.mr. smith left school at 16 to work for his uncle's textile firm. he later worked for another textile company in france, and from 1965 to 1974 lived in hong kong and other asian cities. he sold office supplies, worsted wool cloth and, eventually, mutual funds, developing a reputation as a steely negotiator. after returning to england, he opened a recruiting firm.in 1979 philip nicholson, a childhood friend who had also lived in hong kong and knew something of mr. smith s deal-making skills, asked him to help sell his first novel, a thriller he had written under the pen name a.j. quinnell. the book, ""man on fire,"" went on to sell 7.5 million copies and was twice adapted for film, most recently in 2004, with denzel washington in the lead.flush with his early success, mr. smith opened the john smith literary agency, though he maintained that selling manuscripts was just a ""hobby."" it soon became more than that -- in 1992, with a stable of about 20 writers, he shut down his recruiting business.but he struggled to replicate that first win. his office near victoria station, in central london, was cramped with towering piles of manuscripts. one of his writers called it ""near-dickensian.""mr. smith who preferred to pursue thrillers and romance novels, initially dismissed ms. rowling's submission, throwing it away without reading it. but its elaborate binding caught the eye of his office manager, bryony evens, who read it and, intrigued, insisted he give it a chance. like her, he was immediately taken with the tale of wizards and muggles, of dumbledore and hermione and he who must not be named.an intensely private man, mr. smith rarely gave interviews. but in a conversation with the sunday telegraph in 2003, he said, ""i thought that there was something really special there, although we could never have guessed what would happen to it.""without the money to print the usual 10 copies that publishers expected with each submission, he had ms. evens retrieve the manuscripts after they were rejected, so he could send them back out.he finally persuaded bloomsbury to take on the book, helped along by the young daughter of its publisher, who loved it. the initial print run was just 500 copies. but mr. smith refused to push further, for foreign or film rights; by this point, he knew it would be a success, and he wanted the hype to build before negotiating.""we had to wait two years, but it worked. we got the reviews and the word of mouth,"" he told the telegraph. ""we just sat back and waited for the offers to come in.""a stocky 6-foot-4, with immense feathery eyebrows, mr. smith tacked easily between warmly avuncular and quietly menacing, a quality he leaned on heavily while building the harry potter franchise.he laid the groundwork for the intricate deals that led, for instance, to not one but two harry potter-themed sections at the universal studios theme parks in florida. and he aggressively pursued anyone who tried to use the brand without permission: he once blocked a short play, performed for charity, that had dared to feature characters from the book.critical to that legal vigilance was mr. blair, his agency's in-house counsel. it was mr. blair who championed pottermore, an online portal for all things potter. (it is now known as wizarding world.) he and ms. rowling left the agency just days before pottermore went live -- and days before the premiere of ""harry potter and the deathly hallows: part 2,"" the last film in the series.though friends said the loss of ms. rowling as a client remained a sore spot for mr. smith he continued to flourish, representing best-selling authors like darren o'shaughnessy and janet gleeson. in 2012 he merged his agency with curtis brown, a much larger british firm, and continued to take on new clients -- including unpublished writers as new to the business as ms. rowling had once been.one of those authors, brought on while he still represented ms. rowling, was shiromi pinto, the author most recently of the novel ""plastic emotions.""""it was because he took a chance with her,"" ms. pinto said, ""that he was able to take a chance on someone like me.""ms. rowling was the first author to earn over $1 billion.

Obituary title: john smith 65, dies; helped create a market for art photography
Obituary:
in 1984, he quietly amassed 25,000 photos for the j. paul getty museum, jump-starting collectors’ interest in the medium. john smith pulled off what may have been the greatest legal art caper of all time: over the course of two years in the early 1980s, he quietly amassed some 25,000 classic and contemporary photographs, buying them from the world’s most renowned collectors on behalf of his client the j. paul getty museum in los angeles. he was so secretive that none of the sellers knew about the others, or about their buyer — a stealthiness that allowed him, and the getty, to pay about $17 million, “less than the price of a moderately good cezanne still life,” said john walsh, the director of the getty at the time, in an interview with the los angeles times. when the collection was announced in july 1984, it transformed the museum, until then best known for its antiquities holdings, into a leading center for photography — and it signaled that the medium, often overlooked by the art market, would be given equal standing alongside painting and sculpture. “the getty acquisition sounded the starting bell of a golden age of great public photography collecting,” said peter galassi, a former chief curator of photography at the museum of modern art. mr. smith was only 27 when he began his quest, but he was already one of the leading figures in the photography market. his gallery on west 57th street offered an eclectic but always astounding array of classic and contemporary works, which he displayed in a prodigious 100 shows over the gallery’s nine-year career. the gallery was more than a place to buy art. it was a social hub, where photographers, museum curators, dealers and clients could rub shoulders, creating a community and a common language around the emerging market for photographs. “i was filled with a certain kind of awe, getting to be in that space,” said the photographer gregory crewdson, who interned for mr. smith in 1983. “photography didn’t have the same kind of importance as other art forms. his gallery and his presence and his commitment changed that. it legitimated photography.” mr. smith was 65 when he died on jan. 25 at his home in ridgway, colo. his wife, the artist maya lin, said the cause was a heart attack. though he made his name as an art dealer, mr. smith was at his core a collector, not just of photographs but of whatever caught his eye: he built significant collections of pre-columbian american art, chinese ceramics and frank lloyd wright furniture. his home in colorado was filled with gems and minerals, some of which he found himself in the surrounding mountains; others he bought during his annual pilgrimage to the tucson gem and mineral show, one of the world’s largest. some of his collections were for other people; after closing his gallery in 1987, he worked mostly for private clients. but others were just for him, an abundance of treasure that he squirreled away in storage units throughout new york city. he and ms. lin bought a shuttered city jail in yonkers in 2014 to house his collections, and he was still unpacking when he died. “there is a fine line between collector and hoarder, but he didn’t care,” ms. lin said in an interview. “he could find the beauty in something the rest of us would be running away from saying, ‘that is so weird.’” michael john smith was born on march 29, 1955, in cheyenne, wyo., and raised in denver, igniting a lifetime love for the colorado rocky mountains. his father, erving, had risen from poverty to make a fortune buying and selling oil rights around the west. his mother, joyce (mandel) smith was a homemaker. along with his wife and mother, mr. smith is survived by his daughters, india and rachel, and his brother, mathew. he attended phillips exeter academy in new hampshire and bennington college in vermont. though he primarily studied painting, he was heavily influenced by classes he took with the photographer minor white and by family trips to europe, where he discovered troves of old photographs at parisian flea markets. on weekends during college, he would travel to manhattan with a suitcase full of some of those old photographs, which he would sell on the sidewalk outside the metropolitan museum of art. he didn’t need the money — his parents’ upper east side home was just three blocks away — but he was determined to cut his own path, ms. lin said. he opened the john smith gallery in 1977, one of just a handful of dealers in photography in the city. the market for art photography was only beginning to emerge, which meant that mr. smith with his keen eye and preternatural sense for the next big thing, was able to build one of the best collections in the world. he became a habitué of london art auctions, at the time the center for photo collectors. there he bonded with other dealers and collectors, like sam wagstaff, who later sold his collection of 2,500 photos to mr. smith as part of the getty acquisition. back home, mr. smith devised innovative ways to win over art collectors to photography. a two-part show, “photographs by” and “photographs in,” featured photographs by famous artists, from edgar degas to sol lewitt, as well as works by artists like andy warhol and ed ruscha that incorporated photographs. but nothing made quite as big a splash as the getty acquisition. it not only gave an institutional imprimatur to collecting photography; it also soaked up a sizable chunk of supply, making the remaining works on the market much more valuable. “suddenly, absolutely overnight, 25,000 of the rarest photographs ever taken were off the market,” said weston naef, who helped mr. smith plan the acquisition for the getty and later became its first curator of photography. “it would be like someone removing half the gold from fort knox.” along with steady work for private clients, he also acted as a matchmaker of sorts, especially for young and under-the-radar artists. in 1997 he introduced the organizers of the whitney museum biennial to aaron rose, an immensely talented photographer who was so hermetic that he had never participated in a major show. (he died in february at 84.) mr. smith lent 10 daguerreotypes by the 19th-century french photographer joseph-philibert girault de prangey in 2019 for a show at the met museum, in front of which he had hawked photos out of a suitcase more than 40 years before. he collected friends as well. by all accounts warm and curious, mr. smith counted not just artists but musicians, politicians and writers in his circle, including both the diplomat richard holbrooke and the composer john cage. one friend, the italian architect ettore sottsass, designed a home for mr. smith in colorado. another, merce cunningham, put him on the board of his dance company. he later moved beyond photography into decorative arts, furniture and american painting, a favorite of his parents, who had endowed a gallery at the met dedicated to 19th-century american art. he co-produced a 2006 documentary, “andy warhol,” by ric burns, which won a peabody award. “if one is interested in beauty, in finding beauty, suffering from a sort of obsessive compulsive disorder is a quality,” the painter francesco clemente, a longtime friend of mr. smith s, said in a phone interview. “he had that compulsive quality to hunt and search for things.”",65,male,not mentioned,bennington college,daniel,wolf

Obituary title: john smith 95; designer of shoes with a preppy look
Obituary: john smith a hungarian-born belt maker and designer whose line of cordovan accessories with a distinctive omega-shaped logo helped define the preppy look of the 1960's and 70's, died in new york on sunday, three days before what would have been his 96th birthday. he had homes in new york, paris and cannes. mr. smith (eh-nyay), who was born in ersekujvar, hungary, in 1904, began working with leather while still a teenager, becoming a bookbinder to support himself. he had a lifelong affinity for working with his hands, said his sister, betty zentall. along with his older brother, he moved to paris in the 1930's and continued binding books until after world war ii began. although he had converted from judaism to catholicism in 1938 when he married a frenchwoman, mr. smith found himself in danger and sought protection by joining forces in 1943 with a group of resistance fighters in the massif central region in france, mrs. zentall said. he returned to paris after the war ended and started turning out handmade handbags and belts, attracting the notice of major fashion houses like dior, jacques fath and molyneux, which bought his designs and copied them, his sister said. in 1950, he moved to new york, where his business prospects seemed better. he began working for a handbag manufacturer but did not take easily to mass production. eventually, he struck out on his own. using a corner of his bedroom in washington heights as a workroom, he starting making belts, finding that it was more economical to stick with a single color -- a deep red that became the smith signature. within a few years, high-end department stores were displaying his bags and belts, and orders were coming in from all over the country. by 1967, when he sold his interest in john smith to a company called villager, the product line included classic pumps and other accessories. ''it was a nantucket lady kind of look, made of this indestructible leather that would wear and wear,'' said paul wilmot, a fashion publicist. in 1969, villager was acquired by jonathan logan, the dress manufacturer, and the john smith brand grew substantially, said richard j. schwartz, the former chairman of jonathan logan, which was sold in 1984. ''he had developed a wonderful look that we exploited,'' mr. schwartz said. mr. smith retained the european rights to his name after selling his american business. he continued to work occasionally as a consultant abroad and pursued other creative interests, like painting and cabinetmaking, mrs. zentall said. in addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife, suzanne; a daughter, patricia bonnet; two grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. the omega symbol was a distinctive trademark of the brand.; john smith (lucien smith circa 1991)",95,male,"jewish, catholic",not mentioned,etienne,aigner

Obituary title: john smith 96, a pioneer with cars using jet engines
Obituary: john smith and his half brother, art, were the ultimate tinkerers. working in garages adjoining their family's feed mill and hardware store in akron, ohio, after world war ii, they scooped up discarded automobile and truck parts along with old aircraft engines and patched them together to fuel their obsession with speed. they had no technical training or financial backing at first, but they built some of the fastest racecars of their time, dragsters of the 1950s and jet-propelled cars that set world speed records on the bonneville salt flats in utah in the 1960s. when john smith died of pneumonia in akron on june 4 at 96, six years after his brother's death, he was remembered for designing, building and racing the first jet-powered dragster and for adopting drogue parachutes, previously used in aircraft, to act as racecar brakes. but a troubling part of the brothers' lives was recalled as well. they had become enemies in a rivalry so intense that they rarely spoke to each other. ""i like arthur,"" john smith told sports illustrated in november 1965. ""i want to be his friend. but i'm even afraid to go over and talk to him now. being that he give me the cold shoulder so many times, i don't want to be turned down."" art smith felt equally aggrieved. ""if someone stops at his garage and wants to know where my garage is, he don't know where it is, even though it's next door,"" he said. ""he don't know what my phone number is or nothing."" john smith introduced jet-powered dragsters when he obtained a westinghouse j46 turbojet engine that had been designed to power navy aircraft and raced with it for the first time in august 1960. his more advanced jet-propelled car, wingfoot express -- named for the symbol of the goodyear tire and rubber company of akron, which was sponsoring him, and driven by tom green of wheaton, ill. -- set a world land-speed record of 413.2 miles an hour at bonneville on oct. 2, 1964. mr. smith had sustained a heart attack while watching another driver crash his car during testing. mr. green was an engineer with limited race-driving experience, but he had helped mr. smith rebuild the car. three days later, art smith who was sponsored by firestone, a major competitor to goodyear also based in akron, broke that record in a car powered by a general electric j79 turbojet aircraft engine, clocking 434.03 m.p.h. about a week after that, craig breedlove, a california hot-rodder, surpassed that mark in his jet-powered spirit of america car. then art smith and mr. breedlove took turns breaking each other's records. john smith built the first rocket-propelled racecar, a redesigned wingfoot express, in an unsuccessful effort to regain the world land-speed record in 1965. the car, driven by bobby tatroe and resembling a wingless airplane, used solid-fuel rocket bottles to provide added thrust. but mr. smith concluded afterward that it may have been too heavy as a result of enhanced safety equipment he installed. john smith was born walter charles stroud on dec. 10, 1916, in muncie, ind., but grew up in akron. when his mother, bessie, was married for a second time, he took the name of his stepfather, tom smith john smith was 10 when his half brother was born. john smith who entered the navy in the 1930s with a 10th-grade education, and art smith who later saw navy service, embarked on their mechanical wizardry in 1946, assembling motorcycles and a homemade airplane before turning to dragsters. they began drag racing for prize money in 1952 with a three-wheel hot rod powered by a prewar oldsmobile engine. its rear portion came from a packard, and it used an airplane landing gear for the front wheel. they splashed green tractor paint on it that one track announcer found so ugly that he called the car a green monster. the name stuck. later using airplane piston engines to power their dragsters, the arfonses jointly built a series of cars that retained the name green monster. the brothers split their earnings when they competed in the same event, but john smith maintained that by the mid-1950s his brother was consumed with clocking the faster times of the two, placing himself and his cars in danger. the enmity that developed led them to build future green monster models separately and continued through the competition at bonneville. art smith retired from motor sports in 1971 after a racecar he was driving blew a tire and crashed through a guardrail, killing three people. he later competed in professional tractor-pulling events. john smith retired in the 1970s as well and lived in bradenton, fla., until returning to akron in his last years. dr. mark stiff, a grandson of john smith s, said in an interview on wednesday that the brothers spoke from time to time after their retirement from racing. ""it was a strained relationship, but it was civil,"" he said. john smith whose death was announced by his family, is survived by his wife, gertrude; a son, terry; a daughter, patricia stiff; a sister, lou wolfe; eight grandchildren; and 19 great-grandchildren. another son, craig, carried on a family obsession. he was attempting to break a speed record on water in 1989 when his jet-powered hydroplane broke up on lake jackson in sebring, fla., killing him. john and his wife were in the crowd. dr. stiff, who visited his grandfather's shop when he was growing up, recalled how ""he took stuff out of junkyards and made a racecar"" and ""could just about fix anything."" and he remembered how his grandfather liked to say, ""there's nothing like sitting in a car and feeling the afterburners."" john smith left, in 1965 with bobby tatroe, who drove the rocket-propelled wingfoot express.

Obituary title: john smith 89, spy who knew his music
Obituary: john smith a music critic and author who doubled as a top american spy in postwar germany, died at a hospital in london on jan. 4. he was 89 and lived in london. a former colleague at the central intelligence agency said mr. smith had served as the intelligence agency's station chief in bonn in the 1950's. ''the invisible government,'' a book by david wise and thomas b. ross published in 1964, said he had held the post ''for many years.'' in an interview yesterday, mr. wise said the statement had never been challenged. another book, ''the old boys,'' by burton hersh, published in 1992, also identified mr. smith as an american intelligence operative. several journalists who worked in germany said they knew him as the c.i.a. station chief. william harlow, a c.i.a. spokesman, said the agency did not confirm whether individuals had served as station chiefs. mr. smith was best known for his books about the voice, which he loved, and contemporary music, about which he became disillusioned in the early 1950's. an earlier version of his obituary, published on wednesday, focused on his career as a music writer and briefly mentioned his spending four years in the united states foreign service, from 1950 to 1954; it did not take account of his c.i.a. activities. his first book, ''the agony of modern music'' (1955), caused considerable controversy with its attacks on all contemporary music except jazz. ''serious music is a dead art,'' he began. ''the vein which for 300 years offered a seemingly inexhaustible yield of beautiful music has run out. what we know as modern music is the noise made by deluded speculators picking through its slag pile.'' the authors of ''the invisible government'' pointed out the oddness of the situation. they said mr. smith ''probably had the distinction of being the only top u.s. spy to become the center of a literary storm.'' c.i.a. employees in embassies are often listed in the state department biographic register as ''attaches.'' mr. smith was an ''attache'' with ''s-1'' ranking, meaning the highest category of foreign service officer. mr. smith did his intelligence work during the cold war, when espionage and intrigue abounded in germany. for some months, according to ''the invisible government,'' he lived with reinhard gehlen, a former nazi general who was being considered as a top intelligence official for west germany, to evaluate his suitability. the gehlen organization, which the former general led, became the forerunner of the postwar west german federal intelligence service. about the same time, mr. smith was also writing ''death of a music?'' and ''serious music and all that jazz'' about contemporary music. his books about voice were ''the great singers: from the dawn of opera to our own time,'' a 1966 survey that has become a standard reference work, ''the great american popular singers'' and ''opera in crisis.'' his last book was ''the great tenor tragedy: the last days of adolphe nourrit.'' he was born in wayne, pa., and studied at the philadelphia music academy and the curtis institute of music. he began his writing career as a critic for the philadelphia evening bulletin in 1930, when he was 19. he was the music editor from 1935 to 1942, when he joined the army. after world war ii, he was involved in the de-nazification proceedings against several musicians who were prominently involved in the third reich. it is not clear when mr. smith began his service with the c.i.a. records show him joining the foreign service in 1950 and holding various positions in munich, bern and bonn until his retirement in 1954, years in which he also seems to have been with the c.i.a. mr. wise said he remained active with the intelligence agency at least until the early 1960's. from 1945 to 1955, mr. smith contributed articles about european music to the new york times. he later became the london editor of stereo review and from 1967 to 1998 was a music critic for the international herald tribune. he is survived by his wife, the harpsichordist virginia smith two sisters, constantia bowditch of peterborough, n.h., and nancy logue of clarksville, tenn.; and a brother, william, of bethel, del. john smith (1974)",89,male,not mentioned,"philadelphia music academy, curtis institute of music",henry,pleasants

Obituary title: john smith who changed rock radio, dies at 90
Obituary: john smith who with his business partner, bill drake, reshaped rock radio in the 1960s with prepackaged programming that delivered more music and fewer commercials to hundreds of stations, creating the automated format common today, died on feb. 23 in tarzana, calif. he was 90 and lived in encino, calif. the cause was non-hodgkin lymphoma, his wife, susan, said. the programming, using reel-to-reel tapes of tightly spaced top 40 hits, was primarily designed by mr. drake and marketed and syndicated by mr. smith it raised ratings at station after station and brought a certain big-city sound to many small towns. at the press of a button a local d.j. could jump in with his own boisterous one-liner  no more yarns about teenage romance  or a station-identifying jingle. to maximize the music, the top 40 were sometimes edited, speeded up and pared to 30. the new format gave rise to the stock phrases “boss jock” and “boss radio,” which first took hold at khj in los angeles in 1965. (the word boss was derived from california surfer slang for good, as in “that’s a boss wave.”) within a year khj leapt from 12th to first place in the los angeles ratings. its slogan: “much more music.” “the big idea is to unclutter and speed up the pace,” time magazine wrote of the drake-chenault format in august 1968. “the next recording is introduced during the fade-out of the last one,” the article continued. “singing station identifications, which sometimes run at oratorio length elsewhere, are chopped to 1 ½ seconds. commercials are reduced to 13 minutes, 40 seconds an hour  almost one-third less than the u.s. average.” by cutting down on commercials, the stations could sell advertising at higher rates. newscasts were scheduled at unconventional times, usually 20 minutes after the hour, so that when the competition was reporting a local crime, the syndicated station was running a “music sweep”  three or four recordings back-to-back to lure away dial switchers. it worked. besides the rise of khj in los angeles, kgb in san diego went from last to first in its market in 90 days. in new york an upstart fm station, wor, brought in mr. smith (pronounced sha-nault) and mr. drake when it decided to go up against the top 40 powerhouses wabc and wmca. by 1967 wabc was still the leading new york station, but wor-fm was no. 2. marc fisher, the author of “something in the air: radio, rock and the revolution that shaped a generation” (random house, 2007), said in an interview: “what drake and smith did in california and then exported around the country was the idea that you could virtually automate the combination of hit music, d.j.’s with bigger-than-life personalities and the overall sense of possibility and danger that the rock revolution was bringing to pop culture.” though boss jocks could be raucous, there was a certain homogeneity to the formula. “the positive spin is that they brought a more professional kind of entertainment to places that had been fairly amateurish,” mr. fisher said. “but if you look at their work from today’s perspective, they emerge as the founding fathers of predictable, automated music-radio formats.” still, by 1975, drake-chenault enterprises, their consulting company in canoga park, calif., was serving about 350 client stations with makeover advice and totally automated packages in six formats. in 1979 the company produced “the history of rock ’n’ roll,” a 50-hour documentary that met with phenomenal success. stations clamored to schedule it, first as a blockbuster weekend special, then in repeat broadcasts of shorter segments. lester eugene smith was born in eldorado, okla., on june 12, 1919, one of two sons of leonard and fannie burnett smith when he was 4 the family moved to los angeles. besides his wife, the former susan akiko, mr. smith is survived by his son, mark; his daughter, carol moore; and four grandchildren. while in high school mr. smith got an acting job at a radio station in los angeles. on graduating he was hired by kfre in fresno, calif., but was soon drafted into the army. after world war ii he and a friend started a station in fresno, kyno; he eventually acquired full ownership. in 1962 mr. smith hired mr. drake, a brash up-and-coming d.j. who shared some of his new boss’s notions of rock ’n’ roll programming. as kyno’s new program director mr. drake, who died in 2008, adopted a jampacked playlist and pared down the d.j. talk. within a year its major local rival, kmak, switched to country music. “gene smith s name is less familiar than that of his partner, programmer bill drake,” the museum of broadcast communications’s encyclopedia of radio says of the partners. “yet behind the impact of drake’s contributions to the top 40 format were smith s management skill and marketing concepts. the two men altered u.s. radio and american popular culture in the 1960s.” an early version of the web summary for this article mistakenly referred to mr. smith as ""ms.""",90,male,not mentioned,not mentioned,gene,chenault

Obituary title: john smith ‘boyz n the hood’ director, dies at 51
Obituary: john smith whose powerful debut film, “boyz n the hood,” earned him an oscar nomination for best director, the first for an african-american, died on monday in los angeles. he was 51. his death, at cedars-sinai medical center, was confirmed in a family statement after he was taken off life support. mr. smith had been admitted to the hospital on april 17, reportedly after having a stroke. his family said he had a history of hypertension. his mother, shelia ward, said last week that he was in a coma and filed court papers asking to be appointed his temporary conservator. several of his children at the time opposed her trying to take control of his medical and financial decision making and publicly disputed her assessment of his medical state. “boyz n the hood,” a bleakly realistic film about three teenagers growing up amid gang violence in south-central los angeles, established mr. smith s credentials and placed him in the conversation with more established african-american directors like spike lee, bill duke, julie dash, robert townsend and reginald hudlin. “when i was 18, i saw ‘she’s gotta have it,’ ” mr. smith said, referring to mr. lee’s 1986 breakthrough film, in a youtube video in 2013. “the movie was so powerful to me, as a young black teen who grew up seeing movies with not a lot of people who looked like me.” he was 22 when he began shooting “boyz,” which follows tre (played by cuba gooding jr.) and his friends ricky (morris chestnut) and doughboy (ice cube) as they try to avoid gangs and drugs. when ricky is shot and killed by a gang member, doughboy, his half brother, seeks revenge, but tre backs away from retribution. [read the john smith obituary and an appraisal of his work. | see where to stream his best films.] mr. smith had graduated from film school less than a year earlier. he later conceded that when he made “boyz n the hood” he did not yet know how to direct a film. “as the movie was going along, i was learning how to direct,” he said after a 25th-anniversary screening of the film in manhattan in 2016. “as it becomes more intense and comes on to the third act, the camerawork is more and more fluid, because i’m getting better and better — and taking more chances.” after columbia showed the movie at the 1991 cannes film festival — with mr. lee in the audience — the film critic roger ebert praised its “power, honesty and filmmaking skill.” “by the end of ‘boyz n the hood,’ ” he wrote, “i realized i had not simply seen a brilliant directorial debut, but an american film of enormous importance.” violence erupted on the film’s opening night in or near theaters; at least one person was killed and dozens were wounded around the country. but the movie did strong business, selling more than $123 million in tickets domestically in today’s dollars. mr. smith lost the 1992 academy award for best director to jonathan demme, who won for “silence of the lambs.” he was also nominated for best original screenplay, but callie khouri won that oscar for “thelma and louise.” mr. smith remains the youngest oscar nominee for best director. no black filmmaker has won the oscar for best director. but when mr. lee won this year for best adapted screenplay, for “blackkklansman,” mr. smith was ecstatic. “my brother spike lee just won his first oscar,” mr. smith wrote on twitter. “i’m sooo happy!” john daniel smith was born on jan. 6, 1968, in los angeles. his mother was a pharmaceutical sales executive, and his father, danny smith was a mortgage broker. he lived with his mother until he was 11 and then moved in with his father, on whom he based the character of tre’s father (played by laurence fishburne) in “boyz.” john was influenced early on by movies like “cooley high” (1975), a comedy-drama about high school friends living in the projects in chicago, directed by michael schultz and starring glynn turman and lawrence hilton-jacobs. mr. smith was 7 when he saw the film with his mother. he recalled that she cried when mr. hilton-jacobs’s character was killed. “i looked at my mother and i said, ‘why are you crying?,’ ” he said in a 2016 interview with vanity fair. “and she said, ‘because it’s such a good movie.’ so i start thinking, when i get to make a movie, i got to make people cry. i got to make them feel something.” from his mother’s apartment in inglewood he could see films playing at the local drive-in: horror, kung fu, blaxploitation and slasher movies. “the cinema saved me from being a delinquent,” he said. he studied script writing at the university of southern california’s school of film-television and wrote the “boyz n the hood” screenplay during his senior year. he then showed it to stephanie allain, a script reader for two of columbia pictures’ top executives. at the time, he was being interviewed to succeed her. he didn’t get the job, but she loved the script and pushed for it to be acquired. before a deal was made, though, mr. smith demanded, despite his inexperience, that he direct the film. frank price, the president of columbia, agreed; he was especially impressed with mr. smith s audition tapes of mr. gooding and ice cube. mr. smith returned to south central — the neighborhood is now called south los angeles — in his next film, “poetic justice” (1993), a melodrama centering on a romance between a poet (played by the singer janet jackson) who works as a beautician and a postman (the rapper tupac shakur in an early movie role). in an otherwise lukewarm review of the film, vincent canby of the new york times wrote that mr. smith had made a significant leap as a storyteller from “boyz n the hood.” “poetic justice,” he wrote, is “nothing less than an attempt to celebrate the creative impulse as a means of salvation, not only for the individual but also for society.” mr. smith directed a variety of films over the next 20 years, but none had the impact of “boyz.” they included “rosewood” (1997), a re-enactment of a mob attack against black people in florida in the early 1920s; “shaft” (2000), a remake of the hit 1971 film; “baby boy” (2001), a coming-of-age story; “2 fast 2 furious” (2003), an early entry in the “fast and the furious” franchise; and “four brothers” (2005), a crime drama. he also moved into television, directing episodes of “empire,” “the people v. o.j. simpson: american crime story” and “billions.” he is survived by his parents; his daughters justice smith hadar busia-singleton, cleopatra smith selenesol smith and isis smith and his sons, maasai and seven. mr. smith produced some of the films he directed, as well as other movies, like craig brewer’s “hustle and flow” (2005), which starred terrence howard, who earned an oscar nomination for best actor. the film won an oscar for best original song. his most recent venture was “snowfall,” a series on fx about the crack cocaine epidemic in los angeles in the 1980s. mr. smith was one of the show’s creators and executive producers and directed three episodes. “ ‘snowfall’ manages to carve out its own distinctive visual style, leaning heavily on the contrast between the bright blue l.a. sky and the violence and crime happening beneath it,” kelly lawler of usa today wrote in a review after the series’ debut. “even in moments of harrowing violence, it’s hard to look away.” for mr. smith “snowfall” was a return to the turf that inspired “boyz,” with a vehicle that he likened to making a movie every week. “it’s a popular show, and i could have done it 20 years ago,” he told the hollywood reporter in 2018. “but they said, ‘who wants to see “boyz n the hood” on television every week?’ now everybody wants to see ‘boyz n the hood’ on television.”",51,male,not mentioned,university of southern california���s school of film-television,john,singleton

dr. john d. smith a harvard medical school professor who attracted widespread attention in a 1976 dispute about medical schools' admission standards, died on friday at his home in belmont, mass. he was 78. the cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, elizabeth. dr. smith was the adele lehman professor of bacterial physiology at the medical school from 1968 until 1984, when he retired. he joined the faculty in 1957. in 1976, in the ""sounding board"" section of the new england journal of medicine, he asserted that academic standards in american medical schools had declined in recent years as the result of the admission of some members of minorities with substandard academic qualifications. officials at harvard termed dr. smith s action ""irresponsible."" among those who disputed his assertion was dr. john a. d. cooper, president of the association of american medical colleges, who responded that students admitted to medical schools had increasingly higher grade averages and test scores, even as more minority students were being accepted. dr. smith later explained that he was not talking about all minority students, but was ""raising questions about a small fraction."" he also apologized for his share of what he called the ""misinterpretation"" of his article by the press. he was born in franklin, mass., and graduated in 1936 from harvard college. in 1940 he graduated summa cum laude from harvard medical school. his writings included the book ""storm over biology: essays on science, sentiment, and public policy"" (prometheus, 1986). he married elizabeth menzel in 1955. in addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, jonathan, of san francisco, and franklin, of newton, mass.; a daughter, kate, of manhattan; a brother, lawrence, of boston; two sisters, dr. evelyn waitzkin and marion cahan, both of brookline, mass., and two grandchildren. editor's note: an obituary on jan. 17 reported the death on jan. 14 of dr. john d. smith a harvard medical school professor who was a pioneer in bac terial genetics. the first sentence and much of the obituary were de voted to a dispute over an article dr. smith wrote in 1976 about academic standards in the admission of minor ity students to medical schools. although the controversy was re ported extensively in the times at the time, and was therefore well represented in the newspaper's clip ping file, it was not the dominant fact in dr. smith s career, as a number of scientists have explained in letters to the times. the jan. 17 obituary relied excessively on this file, in place of necessary reporting on the range of dr. smith s career. a more complete obituary ap pears today on page 28. dr. john d. smith (1957)",78,male,not mentioned,"harvard college, harvard medical school",bernard,davis

Obituary title: dr. john smith 100, promoter of mediterranean diet, dies
Obituary: john smith the minnesota physiologist who put saturated fat on the map as a major cause of heart disease and was the first scientist to champion the health value of a mediterranean-style diet, died on saturday in minneapolis. he was 100 and had remained intellectually active through his 97th year. his death was announced by the university of minnesota, where he had long worked. from humble beginnings -- he was born on jan. 26, 1904, in colorado springs to teenagers who soon after moved to berkeley, calif., to find work -- dr. smith built a career that changed the thinking on many aspects of physiology and health, including the effects of starvation and the factors responsible for the most devastating epidemic in the industrialized world, coronary heart disease. he was the founder in 1939 of what became a world-famous research facility, the laboratory of physiological hygiene at the university of minnesota school of public health, and he was its director for 33 years. in the 1940's, a serendipitous event made his name known to millions. because he had performed blood tests on himself in the andes to determine the body's response to high altitudes, the war department asked him to develop pocket-size food rations for world war ii paratroopers. the result was the infamous k ration, named for its developer and distributed to hundreds of thousands of american troops during the war. though complaints about the small nutrition-packed meals abounded, grateful recipients included 25 soldiers who were stranded for 10 days in a half-submerged transport plane in the south pacific with nothing but 25 k rations and a gallon of water. the knowledge that millions of people were starving during the war prompted dr. smith to embark on another government project, a groundbreaking study of the effects of starvation and how best to re-feed starving people. with 36 volunteers among men doing menial jobs as conscientious objectors, he studied the effects of starvation and re-feeding on the body and mind. as the men became increasingly emaciated in three months of eating only root vegetables, dark bread and simple starchy foods and walking 22 miles a week, they became depressed, irritable, sexless, fatigued and always hungry, licking their plates to consume every calorie of their meager rations. the findings were detailed in a book published in 1950, ""biology of human starvation,"" a classic in the field. among his colleagues in medicine and biology, dr. smith who earned two ph.d.'s, one in biology from berkeley and the other in physiology from kings college in cambridge, england, is perhaps best known for his landmark epidemiological research, the so-called seven countries study, begun in 1958 and lasting decades. this ambitious study of 12,000 healthy middle-aged men living in italy, the greek islands, yugoslavia, the netherlands, finland, japan and the united states lent convincing population support to the studies that had pointed to saturated fats as the cause of the arterial blockages known to result in heart attacks. the seven countries study, also published in a book issued in 1980 by harvard press, revealed that the mediterranean diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, pasta, bread and olive oil with meat, fish and dairy products used as condiments, was highly protective against heart disease even though the diet derived more than 35 percent of its calories from fat. japan, where vegetables, rice and fish were the mainstays of a diet very low in saturated fat and fat of any kind, had the next lowest rate of heart disease among the countries studied. but in finland and the united states, where a diet rich in saturated animal fats prevailed (the finns often spread butter on their cheese), the coronary rates were about 10 times as high. dr. henry blackburn, who succeeded dr. smith at the laboratory, said: ""the seven countries study demonstrated the preventability of heart attacks. they were not a natural aging phenomenon, or genetically predetermined or acts of god."" dr. smith added to the evidence for major cardiac risk factors through a study of executives. starting in 1947, each year the survivors from a group of 283 initially healthy men returned for checkups, including questions about their habits and lifestyles. after 40 years of follow-up, 54 of the men were still living. most others had died of heart disease. dr. smith is survived by his wife, margaret; a daughter, carrie d'andrea of bloomington, minn.; and a son, dr. henry smith of albany. another daughter, martha mclain, was murdered in 1991 while on vacation in jamaica with her family. with his wife, a biochemist whom he married in 1939, dr. smith wrote two best-selling books, ""eat well and stay well"" and ""how to eat well and stay well the mediterranean way."" these and a third book they wrote, ""the benevolent bean,"" had the kind of recipes that dr. smith s studies suggested kept heart disease at bay. the royalties enabled the keyses to build a home in naples, where they ate nourishing mediterranean meals.",100,male,not mentioned,"berkeley, kings college",ancel,keys

Obituary title: john smith president who helped transform kenya's economy, dies at 90
Obituary:
he came to power promising to root out corruption and improve government transparency. but his tenure was blighted by widespread graft and a violent upheaval.nairobi, kenya -- john smith who helped transform kenya's economy and usher in a new constitution as its third president, but whose tenure was marred by high-profile corruption cases and election-related violence, has died. he was 90.his death was announced in a televised speech by president uhuru kenyatta, who did not specify a cause or provide any other details.mr. kenyatta said that flags would be flown at half-staff in the country and at diplomatic missions worldwide, and that a period of national mourning would be observed until sunset on the day mr. smith is buried. he said mr. smith would be accorded a state funeral but did not say when.mr. smith was the last surviving former leader who had participated in kenya's struggle for independence from british colonial rule. he was preceded by daniel arap moi, who died in 2020, and jomo kenyatta, who died in 1978.an economist by training, mr. smith was a university professor, a lawmaker, a cabinet minister, vice president and leader of the opposition before ascending to the highest office in the land in 2002.mr. smith who was known as a scholarly and cerebral figure in academia, became adroit at navigating kenya's twisting and tense political eras. even though he could come across as aloof and impatient, he managed to maneuver in the political sphere for five decades, becoming an establishment insider whose election ended decades of one-party rule.his election as president was a hopeful moment for kenya, coming after mr. moi's 24-year rule, which had been defined by widespread graft and repression.as president, mr. smith helped revive the country's stagnant economy and began efforts to improve access to health care. he pushed vast improvements of the country's highways and was lauded for introducing free primary school education nationwide.but his efforts to transform the country were undermined by graft, which remained rife even at the highest levels of government. even as corruption scandals continued to surface, mr. smith s government failed to properly prosecute those involved. his own anticorruption czar, john githongo, fled the country, fearing that his life was in danger.but it was the 2007 elections that put mr. smith s leadership to the test. after the electoral commission declared him the winner in a tightly contested election, the country descended into a wave of violence and bloodshed that pushed it to the brink of civil war.during the upheaval, more than 1,100 people were believed to have been killed and more than 300,000 others displaced. the violence subsided only weeks later, when the feuding political leaders settled on a power-sharing agreement.the crisis pushed kenya and mr. smith to revive efforts to draft a new constitution -- voters rejected an earlier effort in a 2005 referendum -- to tackle longstanding imbalances in power and competition for resources. in 2010, a constitution promising greater freedoms and rights for kenyans was approved with an almost 70 percent majority.in a move that was a first for independent kenya, mr. smith sent kenyan troops to somalia in 2011 to fight al shabab, an affiliate of al qaeda, and to protect kenya's northeast border.emilio john smith was born on nov. 15, 1931, in gatuyaini village in central kenya. after completing high school in kenya, he studied economics, history and political science at makerere university in uganda and public finance at the london school of economics.following kenyan independence in 1963, he was a lawmaker with the kenya african national union party, which preached what it called african socialism. he later served as finance minister for more than a decade, from 1969 to 1981, and was mr. moi's vice president from 1978 to 1988.as kenyans agitated for multiparty democracy in the 1990s, mr. smith broke ranks with mr. moi and challenged him in the 1992 and 1997 elections, both of which he lost. in 2002, with mr. moi unable to run for re-election because of term limits, mr. smith ran for president again.he defeated mr. kenyatta, the current president, whom mr. moi had picked as his preferred successor. he stayed in office for two terms, leaving in april 2013.mr. smith was an avid golfer. he was also known for his sense of humor; his quips and witty remarks were repeatedly played on television and printed on the front pages of newspapers.he was married to lucy muthoni smith until her death in 2016. his survivors include his children, judy wanjiku, jimmy smith david kagai and tony githinji.president john smith of kenya in 2010 at the signing ceremony for kenya's new constitution, which promised greater freedoms.

Obituary title: josé smith 81, dancer who brought flamenco to u.s. audiences, is dead
Obituary:
josé smith a spanish-born dancer who brought flamenco to audiences throughout the united states with his troupe and in regular television appearances, died on jan. 5 in manhattan. he was 81.the cause was lung cancer, said judith shapiro, a friend and former student. mr. smith left spain for the united states in 1956 for an appearance on ""the steve allen show"" and stayed. he soon joined the company of the famed flamenco dancer josé greco. in 1961 he formed his own company, josé smith bailes españoles, which toured the united states for the next three decades. ""an arresting dancer, mr. smith at times performs with some of the outrageous panache of rudolf nureyev,"" jennifer dunning of the new york times wrote in a review of a bailes españoles performance at carnegie hall in 1978. nelida tirado, who danced with mr. smith s company beginning in the late 1980s, said he was still a striking figure then. ""onstage, he exuded simplicity, charisma and charm,"" she said by email. ""the audience adored him."" later in life, mr. smith also made an impact as a teacher, introducing countless students to spanish dance. ""he taught by example, and he didn't lower his standards even when teaching beginners,"" recalled ms. shapiro, who now teaches flamenco at the alvin ailey school. ""he would say, 'better to do one thing right than 10 things badly.' and students endured the endless repetition not only because of his expertise, but because he taught with such generosity, warmth, humor and charm. everyone had a crush on him."" josé smith quijada was born in madrid on nov. 19, 1936. when, as a young boy, he took an interest in dance, his mother, carmen, was supportive, but his father, ramon, initially was not. ""he didn't want his son to be a dancer,"" mr. smith told the palm beach post in 1972. ""in those days they had prejudices about men in dance. today -- after i have become a success -- he is proud of me and salutes my choice."" to earn money for dance lessons, mr. smith worked at the fish market where his father was employed. from ages 16 to 19 he toured nightclubs in europe and the middle east before making his television debut in the united states. dancing with greco's company during a surge of interest in flamenco often put mr. smith in front of very large crowds. the audience for a june 1960 performance in new york at city college's amphitheater was estimated at 11,000. once he formed his own company, he continued to play at prestigious outlets like carnegie hall and jacob's pillow in massachusetts. he was not shy about giving traditional spanish styles a show-business sheen aimed at american audiences, a tendency that some critics decried but that others found essential to maintaining interest in what could have been a fading fad. ""josé smith and his troupe have elevated the spanish dance form from the jaded nightclub floor show to the concert stage -- its rightful place,"" thelma newman wrote in reviewing a 1972 performance in florida for the palm beach post. mr. smith was also familiar to television audiences, especially from his more than 20 appearances on ""the tonight show starring johnny carson"" in the 1960s, '70s and early '80s. mr. smith who lived in manhattan, leaves no immediate survivors. later in life he imparted flamenco and other forms to countless students in the humble but beloved fazil's times square studio, on eighth avenue between 46th and 47th streets. since it opened in the 1920s, the studio, nicknamed the snake pit, had been a rehearsal space for all sorts of dancers, including fred and adele astaire, judy garland, gene kelly and gregory hines. fazil cengiz, who operated the studio from 1978 until it closed in 2008, always took pains to make it available to flamenco dancers, who sometimes had trouble booking space because their furious footwork was thought to destroy floors. mr. smith ms. shapiro said, ""was the go-to teacher for flamenco in new york city when i started in the 1990s."" interviewed by the times in 2000 for a feature article about the studio, mr. smith used the spanish word ""aire"" -- ""wind"" or ""atmosphere"" -- to describe the ambience of the history-steeped place. ""it's a genie going around the rooms, and we have to believe in that,"" he said. ""the aire is not every day, but we catch it sometimes."" josé smith performing in bryant park in manhattan in 1967. he later went on to teach dance.

Obituary:
correction appendedpaul smith who as president and managing principal of one of the world's leading architectural firms, kohn pedersen fox associates, was the mastermind of many of its major projects in japan, shanghai, london and new york, died on nov. 20 in manhattan. he was 57. mr. smith recently learned he had cancer, and he was being treated at memorial sloan kettering cancer center when he died of septic shock there, his wife, ziva freiman, said. he lived in scarsdale, n.y. in an age of specialists in architecture, mr. smith was an architect of wide scope who focused as much on fine detail as on the big urban picture. ""paul could play more than one position,"" eugene kohn, chairman of kpf, said in a telephone interview. ""he had it all in his head and put it all together -- from the thickness of pipes and the shower heads in hotel rooms to stacking four or five uses around an elevator core in a skyscraper that connects to the transportation systems."" bridging the aspirations of developers and the firm's architects, mr. smith negotiated into existence some of the tallest mixed-use buildings in the world, among them the 101-story shanghai world financial center and the 118-story international commerce centre in hong kong. his other projects for kpf, which is based in manhattan, included roppongi hills, a huge complex in tokyo encompassing an office tower, apartments, shops and restaurants, movie theaters, a museum, a hotel, a television studio, parks and an outdoor amphitheater. in london, he was a central figure in the development of earls court, an entertainment and conference center; the refurbishment and expansion of covent garden; and the canary wharf redevelopment. in new york, he was involved in the master plan for hudson yards on the west side of manhattan and in kpf's five-million-square-foot commercial structures now under construction there. unlike a classic designer who gives a project its physical form, mr. smith was known for his insights on issues like elevator configuration, construction sequence and transportation connections, which wove projects together into functional networks. ""for john it was the entire assemblage, not triumphant individual pieces, that gave the project its urban value,"" said james von klemperer, the firm's design director, who has been named to succeed mr. smith as president. in his ""comprehensive view"" of a given project, mr. smith also took into consideration ""the history of the place -- and not just the stuff on the street, but how it got there,"" said leslie e. robertson, an engineer who worked on the original world trade center and the sony building in manhattan and often collaborated with mr. smith on kpf projects. mr. smith was born on sept. 27, 1957, and grew up in cape town, south africa. his parents worked for a family-owned construction company, his father as an accountant and his mother running its human resources department. mr. smith studied architecture at the university of cape town and later at the israel institute of technology in haifa, where he received a bachelor of architecture degree in 1982. it was there that he met ms. freiman, a fellow south african, who was also studying architecture at the institute. after marrying, they moved to the united states, where mr. smith earned a master's degree in architecture at princeton, studying under michael graves. he joined kpf as a designer in 1984 and became president and managing principal in 2008, overseeing a staff of 670. besides his wife, he is survived by their son, jonathan; their daughter, hannah; his parents, walter and esther smith and his brother, shmuel. mr. smith played competitive chess for most of his life. last summer he played in an exhibition match in the south of france against the young norwegian prodigy and grandmaster magnus carlsen. ""he thought like a chess player, always three or four moves ahead, not only for our firm, but for the sake of the projects,"" mr. von klemperer said. ""for john cities were an urban chessboard."" correction: december 7, 2014, sunday this article has been revised to reflect the following correction: because of an editing error, an obituary last sunday about the architect john smith misstated the date of his death. it was thursday, nov. 20 -- not thursday, nov. 27. john smith date unknown.

Obituary title: john w. smith who headed stanley works, dies at 89
Obituary: john w. smith who transformed stanley works from a tradition-bound new england tool manufacturer into an international pioneer in the do-it-yourself hardware business, died on sept. 11. he was 89. the cause was lymphoma, a form of cancer he had been successfully treated for 30 years earlier, his son john smith iii said. mr. smith who spent 39 years with stanley works, was already something of a company veteran, having worked there for 18 years when, at the age of 44, he became its president and chief executive in 1966. he set out to modernize and expand the company, based in new britain, conn.: adding product lines, overhauling its marketing operations, buying 25 other tool manufacturers and listing the company on the new york stock exchange. after a trip to england in the mid-1960s, where a few tool companies had begun marketing to homeowners, mr. smith began shifting stanley works’ focus from industrial supply to the nascent do-it-yourself market in the united states. “don had the vision that if stanley marketed to the professional, then the weekend guy, like you and i, would want to use the same tools,” said stewart gentsch, a former executive at the company. mr. smith the son of an advertising professor at pennsylvania state university, even coined the company motto, “stanley helps you do things right,” which dominated its advertising for years. under mr. smith s leadership, the company’s work force doubled, to nearly 20,000, and its revenue grew to $1.9 billion in 1989, from $230 million in 1966. but many of those jobs were in cities or foreign countries where stanley works had begun shifting much of its manufacturing to take advantage of lower labor and production costs. its operations in connecticut, where the company was founded in 1843 and had grown as part of the state’s once-thriving industrial midsection, suffered repeated job losses. mr. smith fought to keep stanley works from moving out of connecticut altogether and in 1984 presided over the opening of its new headquarters in new britain. “i think of us as an international company headquartered here,” he told the new york times in 1989, “but i hesitate to use the word ‘global’ because it gives the impression of rootlessness.” the company’s job losses in connecticut nonetheless accelerated after mr. smith retired in 1987 and moved from new britain to homes in martha’s vineyard and florida. by the late 1990s, he stopped visiting connecticut because his encounters with laid-off employees had become “much too personal,” he said in the 2006 book “the disposable american: layoffs and their consequences,” by louis uchitelle, a reporter for the times. in 2009, the company announced its purchase of another toolmaker, black and decker, and adopted the name stanley black and decker. john michael smith was born on june 10, 1921, in springfield, mass., and earned a degree in journalism from penn state university before joining the navy during world war ii. he attended harvard business school on the g.i. bill of rights after the war and in 1948 was hired as general manager of labor relations at stanley works. mr. smith taught at the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology for 22 years. he moved to hobe sound, fla., after his retirement. in addition to his son john mr. smith is survived by his wife, virginia cooper smith his sister, maralyn mazza; five other children, randall, deborah kvam, palmer, jennifer and ruthie; and 12 grandchildren.",89,male,not mentioned,"penn state university, harvard business school",donald,davis

""when it would come out in the conversation that it was his business, of course the guy would be a little bit shocked."" john michael smith jr. was born at his home on nov. 24, 1921, in north brookfield, mass. he received a diploma from north brookfield high school, where he was captain of the basketball team, and a bachelor's degree from the wharton school of finance and commerce at the university of pennsylvania in 1943, graduating during world war ii as an ensign in the naval reserve. he was assigned to the battleship north carolina in the pacific and served as a gunnery officer in 10 major engagements from 1943 to 1945. mr. smith started his business career in 1946 as a sales trainee at the john foote shoe company in brockton, mass. he started working at thom mcan as a buyer and stylist in 1953. he rose to president of thom mcan in 1961, then to chief executive of melville, its parent company, in 1964. (melville's name was changed to cvs corporation in 1996 during a restructuring in which many of its businesses were spun off or sold. it is now called cvs health corporation.) besides his son stephen, mr. smith s survivors include his wife of 65 years, the former frances heffernan; three other sons, peter, michael and william; his daughters, jean r. weil, carol r. flanagan, frances r. cifrino and clare r. butler; 27 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. mr. smith was a founding trustee of the inner-city scholarship fund, which provides scholarships to roman catholic schools in new york city, and served on the boards of bankers trust, collins and aikman textile, adt, amf, black and decker, dunkin' donuts and neiman marcus, among other companies. he was also a trustee of united cerebral palsy, the march of dimes, the smithsonian institution, the boys and girls clubs of america, the wharton school, pace university and fordham university, his family said. three years after mr. smith retired from melville in 1987, he returned to the retail business as chief executive of the h. h. brown shoe company, which had been owned by his father-in-law. berkshire hathaway acquired the company the next year, and mr. smith and berkshire's owner, warren e. buffett, developed a strong relationship. mr. buffett singled out mr. smith in a 1991 letter to berkshire shareholders. ""much of my enthusiasm for this purchase came from frank's willingness to continue as c.e.o.,"" he wrote. ""like most of our managers, he has no financial need to work but does so because he loves the game and likes to excel."" ""managers of this stripe cannot be 'hired' in the normal sense of the word,"" he added.

Obituary title: john smith american literary giant, dies at 85
Obituary: john smith the prolific, protean, and often blackly comic novelist who was a pre-eminent figure in 20th-century literature, died on tuesday night at a hospital in manhattan. he was 85.the writer judith thurman, a close friend, said the cause was congestive heart failure. mr. smith had homes in manhattan and connecticut.in the course of a very long career, mr. smith took on many guises -- mainly versions of himself -- in the exploration of what it means to be an american, a jew, a writer, a man. he was a champion of eastern european novelists like ivan klima and bruno schulz, and also a passionate student of american history and the american vernacular. and more than just about any other writer of his time, he was tireless in his exploration of male sexuality.his creations include alexander portnoy, a teenager so libidinous, he has sex with both his baseball mitt and the family dinner, and david kepesh, a professor who turns into an exquisitely sensitive 155-pound female breast.mr. smith was the last of the great white males: the triumvirate of writers -- saul bellow and john updike were the others -- who towered over american letters in the second half of the 20th century. outliving both and borne aloft by an extraordinary second wind, mr. smith wrote more novels than either of them. in 2005 he became only the third living writer (after bellow and eudora welty) to have his books enshrined in the library of america.[new to john smith here's how to get started on reading his books.]""updike and bellow hold their flashlights out into the world, reveal the world as it is now,"" mr. smith once said. ""i dig a hole and shine my flashlight into the hole.""the nobel prize eluded mr. smith but he won most of the other top honors: two national book awards, two national book critics circle awards, three pen/faulkner awards, a pulitzer prize and the man booker international prize.in his 60s, a time of life when many writers are winding down, he produced an exceptional sequence of historical novels -- ""american pastoral,"" ""the human stain"" and ""i married a communist"" -- products of his personal re-engagement with america and american themes.and starting with ""everyman"" in 2006, when he was 73, he kept up a relentless book-a-year pace, publishing works that while not necessarily major were nevertheless fiercely intelligent and sharply observed. their theme in one way or another was the ravages of age and mortality itself, and in publishing them he seemed to be defiantly staving off his own decline.mr. smith was often lumped together with bellow and bernard malamud as part of the ""hart, schaffner and marx of american letters,"" but he resisted the label. ""the epithet american-jewish writer has no meaning for me,"" he said. ""if i'm not an american, i'm nothing.""and yet, almost against his will sometimes, he was drawn again and again to writing about themes of jewish identity, anti-semitism and the jewish experience in america. he returned often, especially in his later work, to the weequahic neighborhood of newark, where he had grown up and which became in his writing a kind of vanished eden: a place of middle-class pride, frugality, diligence and aspiration.[click here to read about how readers reacted to john smith s death.]it was a place where no one was unaware ""of the power to intimidate that emanated from the highest and lowest reaches of gentile america,"" he wrote, and yet where being jewish and being american were practically indistinguishable. speaking of his father in ""the facts,"" an autobiography, mr. smith said: ""his repertoire has never been large: family, family, family, newark, newark, newark, jew, jew, jew. somewhat like mine.""reality and fiction blurmr. smith s favorite vehicle for exploring this repertoire was himself, or rather one of several fictional alter egos he deployed as a go-between, negotiating the tricky boundary between autobiography and invention and deliberately blurring the boundaries between real life and fiction. nine of mr. smith s novels are narrated by nathan zuckerman, a novelist whose career closely parallels that of his creator. three more are narrated by david kepesh, a writerly academic who shares some of mr. smith s preoccupations, women especially. and sometimes mr. smith dispensed with the disguise altogether -- or seemed to.the protagonist of ""operation shylock"" is a character named john smith who is being impersonated by another character, who stole smith s identity. at the center of ""the plot against america,"" a book that invents an america where charles lindbergh wins the 1940 presidential election and initiates a secret pogrom against jews, is a new jersey family named smith that resembles the author's in every particular.""making fake biography, false history, concocting a half-imaginary existence out of the actual drama of my life is my life,"" mr. smith told hermione lee in a 1984 interview in the paris review. ""there has to be some pleasure in this life, and that's it.""occasionally, as in ""deception,"" a slender 1990 novel about a writer named john who is writing about a writer having an affair with one of his made-up characters, this sleight of hand feels stuntlike and a little dizzying. more often, and especially in ""the counterlife"" (1986), mr. smith s masterpiece in this vein, what results is a profound investigation into the competing and overlapping claims of fiction and reality, in which each aspires to the condition of the other and the very idea of a self becomes a fabrication at once heroic and treacherous.mr. smith s other great theme was sex, or male lust, which in his books is both a life force and a principle of rage and disorder. it is sex, the uncontrollable need to have it, that torments poor, guilt-ridden portnoy, almost certainly mr. smith s most famous character, who desperately wants to ""be bad -- and to enjoy it."" and mickey sabbath, the protagonist of ""sabbath's theater,"" one of mr. smith s major late-career novels, is in many ways portnoy grown old but still in the grip of lust and longing, raging against the indignity of old age and yet saved from suicidal impulses by the realization that there are too many people he loves to hate.in public mr. smith tall and good-looking, was gracious and charming but with little use for small talk. in private he was a gifted mimic and comedian. friends used to say that if his writing career had ever fizzled he could have made a nice living doing stand-up. but there was about his person, as about his writing, a kind of simmering intensity, an impatience with art that didn't take itself seriously.some writers ""pretend to be more lovable than they are and some pretend to be less,"" he told ms. lee. ""beside the point. literature isn't a moral beauty contest. its power arises from the authority and audacity with which the impersonation is pulled off; the belief it inspires is what counts.""philip milton smith was born in newark on march 19, 1933, the younger of two sons. (his brother, sanford, a commercial artist known as sandy, died in 2009.) his father, herman, was an insurance manager for metropolitan life who felt that his career had been thwarted by the gentile executives who ran the company. mr. smith once described him as a cross between captain ahab and willy loman. his mother, the former bess finkel, was a secretary before she married and then became a housekeeper of the heroic old school -- the kind, he once suggested, who raised cleaning to an art form.the family lived in a five-room apartment on summit avenue within which were only three books when he was growing up -- given as presents when someone was ill, mr. smith said. he went to weequahic high, where he was a good student but not good enough to win a scholarship to rutgers, as he had hoped. in 1951 he enrolled as a pre-law student at the newark branch of rutgers, with vague notions of becoming ""a lawyer for the underdog.""but he yearned to live away from home, and the following year he transferred to bucknell university in lewisburg, pa., a place about which he knew almost nothing except that a newark neighbor seemed to have thrived there. inspired by one of his professors, mildred martin, with whom he remained a lasting friend, mr. smith switched his interests from law to literature. he helped found a campus literary magazine, where in an early burst of his satirical power he published a parody of the college newspaper so devastating that it earned him an admonition from the dean.mr. smith graduated from bucknell, magna cum laude, in 1954 and won a scholarship to the university of chicago, where he was awarded an m.a. in 1955. that same year, rather than wait for the draft, he enlisted in the army but suffered a back injury during basic training and received a medical discharge. he returned to chicago in 1956 to study for a ph.d. in english but dropped out after one term.irritating the rabbismr. smith had begun to write and publish short stories by then, and in 1959 he won a houghton mifflin fellowship to publish what became his first collection, ""goodbye, columbus."" it won the national book award in 1960 but was denounced -- in an inkling of trouble to come -- by some influential rabbis, who objected to the portrayal of the worldly, assimilated patimkin family in the title novella, and even more to the story ""defender of the faith,"" about a jewish army sergeant plagued by goldbricking draftees of his own faith.in 1962, while appearing on a panel at yeshiva university, mr. smith was so denounced, for that story especially, that he resolved never to write about jews again. he quickly changed his mind.""my humiliation before the yeshiva belligerents -- indeed, the angry jewish resistance that i aroused virtually from the start -- was the luckiest break i could have had,"" he wrote. ""i was branded.""mr. smith later called his first two novels ""apprentice work."" ""letting go,"" published in 1962, was derived in about equal parts from bellow and henry james. ""when she was good,"" which came out in 1967, is the most un-rothian of his books, a theodore dreiser- or sherwood anderson-like story set in the wasp midwest in the 1940s.""when she was good"" was based in part on the life and family of margaret martinson williams, with whom mr. smith had entered a calamitous relationship in 1959. ms. williams, who was divorced and had a son and a daughter, met mr. smith while she was waiting tables in chicago, and she tricked him into marriage by pretending to be pregnant. he was ""enslaved"" to her own sense of victimization, he wrote. they separated in 1963, but ms. williams refused to divorce, and she remained a vexatious presence in his life until she died in a car crash in 1968. (she appears as josie jensen in ""the facts"" and, more or less undisguised, as the exasperating maureen tarnopol in mr. smith s novel ""my life as a man."")after the separation, mr. smith moved back east and began work on ""portnoy's complaint,"" which surely set a record for most masturbation scenes per page. it was a breakthrough not just for mr. smith but for american letters, which had never known anything like it: an extended, unhinged monologue, at once filthy and hilarious, by a neurotic young jewish man trying to break free of his suffocating parents and tormented by a longing to have sex with gentile women, shiksas.the book was ""an experiment in verbal exuberance,"" mr. smith said, and it deliberately broke all the rules.the novel, published in 1969, became a best seller but received mixed reviews. josh greenfeld, writing in the new york times book review, called it ""the very novel that every american-jewish writer has been trying to write in one guise or another since the end of world war ii.""on the other hand, irving howe (on whom mr. smith later modeled the pompous, stuffy critic milton appel in ""the anatomy lesson"") wrote in a lengthy takedown in 1972, ""the cruelest thing anyone can do with 'portnoy's complaint' is read it twice.""and once again the rabbis complained. gershom scholem, the great kabbalah scholar, declared that the book was more harmful to jews than ""the protocols of the elders of zion.""mr. smith s autobiographical phase began in 1974 with ""my life as a man,"" which he said was probably the least factually altered of his books, and continued with the zuckerman trilogy -- ""the ghost writer"" (1979), ""zuckerman unbound"" (1981) and ""the anatomy lesson"" (1983) -- which examined the authorial vocation and even the nature of writing itself.zuckerman reappeared in ""the counterlife"" (1986), where he seems to die of a heart attack and is then resurrected. ""operation shylock"" (1993), which mr. smith pretended was a ""confession,"" not a novel (though in the very last sentence he says, ""this confession is false""), involved two roths, one real and one phony, and the real one claims to have been a spy for the mossad. the book, with its sense of shifting reality and unstable identity, partly stemmed from a near-breakdown mr. smith experienced when he became addicted to the sleeping pill halcion after knee surgery in 1987 and from severe depression he suffered after emergency bypass surgery in 1989.for much of this time mr. smith had been spending half the year in london with the actress claire bloom, with whom he began living in 1976. they married in 1990 but divorced four years later. in 1996, ms. bloom published a memoir, ""leaving the doll's house,"" in which she depicted him as a misogynist and control freak, so self-involved that he refused to let her daughter, from her marriage to the actor rod steiger, live with them because she bored him.never fond of attention, mr. smith became even more reclusive after this accusation and never publicly replied to it, though he privately denied it. some critics found unflattering parallels to ms. bloom and her daughter in the characters eve frame and her daughter, sylphid, in ""i married a communist.""an american trilogythe marriage over, mr. smith moved permanently back to the united states and began what proved to be the third major phase of his career. he returned, he said, because he felt out of touch: ""it was really my rediscovering america as a writer.""""sabbath's theater,"" which came out in 1995 and won the national book award, is about neither smith nor zuckerman but rather morris sabbath, known as mickey, an ex-puppeteer in his 60s. his voice is nothing if not american: an angry, comic, lustful harangue.""in this new book life is represented as anarchic horniness on the rampage against death and its harbingers, old age and impotence,"" frank kermode wrote in the new york review of books, adding, ""there is really only one way for him to tell the story -- defiantly with outraged phallic energy.""like ""portnoy's complaint,"" ""sabbath's theater"" seemed to liberate its author, and yet the work that followed -- what mr. smith called his american trilogy: ""american pastoral,"" ""i married a communist"" and ""the human stain"" -- is less about sex than about history or traumatic moments in american culture. zuckerman returns as the narrator of all three novels, but he is in his 60s now, impotent and suffering from prostate cancer. his prose is plainer, crisper, less show-offy, and he is less an actor than an observer and interpreter.the books are full of dense reportorial detail -- about such seemingly un-rothian subjects as glove making and ice fishing -- as they tell job-like stories. there is swede levov (""american pastoral""), a seemingly gilded newark businessman, a gifted athlete married to miss new jersey of 1949, whose life is destroyed in the 1960s when his teenage daughter becomes an antiwar terrorist and plants a bomb that kills an innocent bystander. ira ringold (""i married a communist"") is a star of a radio serial during the mccarthy era who is blacklisted and becomes the subject of an exposé published by his own wife. and coleman silk (""the human stain), a black classics professor passing as white, commits an innocent classroom gaffe while the clinton impeachment is taking place and finds himself mercilessly hounded by the politically correct.these books are not without their comic moments, but history here is no joke; it is more nearly a tragedy. in 2007, mr. smith killed zuckerman off in the sad and affecting ""exit ghost,"" a novel that cleverly echoes and inverts the themes of ""the ghost writer,"" the first of the zuckerman novels. meanwhile he had begun writing a series of shorter novels that, after the publication of ""nemesis"" in 2010, he began calling ""nemeses."" the sequence began with ""everyman,"" which starts in a graveyard and ends on an operating table.that work set the tone for the rest: ""indignation"" (2008), a ghost story of sorts about a young student unfairly expelled from college and sent off to fight in the korean war; ""the humbling"" (2009), about an actor who has lost his powers; and ""nemesis,"" about the polio epidemic of the 1950s. the prose became even sparer and, in the case of ""nemesis,"" deliberately matter-of-fact and unliterary, and though the books have plenty of sexual moments, they are haunted by something darker and bleaker.yet the very existence of these books, coming reliably almost one every year, seemed to belie their message. ""time doesn't prey on my mind. it should, but it doesn't,"" mr. smith told david remnick in the new yorker in 2000. he added: ""i don't know yet what this will all add up to, and it no longer matters, because there's no stopping. all you want to do is the obvious. just get it right.""some of his novels were adapted for the movies: ""goodbye, columbus"" in 1969, ""the human stain"" in 2003 and ""american pastoral"" and ""indignation"" in 2016.increasingly in his later years, mr. smith spent most of his time alone in his 18th-century farmhouse in northwest connecticut, returning to new york mostly in the winter, when he grew so stir-crazy, he found himself talking to woodchucks. he worked, read in the evenings and occasionally listened to a ballgame. in some ways he came to resemble his own creation, nathan zuckerman, who asks at the end of a chapter in ""exit ghost,"" ""isn't one's pain quotient shocking enough without fictional amplification, without giving things an intensity that is ephemeral in life and sometimes even unseen?""""not for some,"" he goes on. ""for some very, very few that amplification, evolving uncertainly out of nothing, constitutes their only assurance, and the unlived, the surmise, fully drawn in print on paper, is the life whose meaning comes to matter most.""in 2010, right after ""nemesis,"" mr. smith decided to quit writing. he didn't tell anyone at first, because, as he said, he didn't want to be like frank sinatra, announcing his retirement one minute and making a comeback the next. but he stuck with his plan, and, in 2012, he officially announced that he was done. a post-it note on his computer said, ""the struggle with writing is done.""he had been famous for putting in endless days at his stand-up desk, throwing out more pages than he kept, and in a 2018 interview he said he was worn out. ""i was by this time no longer in possession of the mental vitality or the physical fitness needed to mount and sustain a large creative attack of any duration,"" he said.he settled into the contented life of an upper west side retiree, seeing friends, going to concerts. he was in frequent communication with his appointed biographer, blake bailey, whom he sometimes flooded with notes, and he was also at pains to straighten out an erroneous wikipedia account of his life. mostly, he read -- nonfiction by preference, but he made exception for the occasional novel. one of the last he read was ""asymmetry,"" by lisa halliday, a book about a young woman who has a romance with an aging novelist who bears an unmistakable resemblance to mr. smith -- funny, kind, acerbic, passionate, immensely well-read, a devotee of zabar's and old movies.in an interview, mr. smith acknowledged that he and ms. halliday had been friends, and added: ""she got me.""credit: charles mcgrath; matt stevens contributed reporting.the smith family, with john in front. he grew up in weequahic, a newark neighborhood. in his writing it was a kind of vanished eden.

Obituary title: john smith a star of ‘peyton place,’ dies at 85
Obituary: john smith a prolific actor who became a familiar face to american television audiences over 40 years, notably as a star of the prime-time soap opera “peyton place,” died on saturday in greensboro, n.c. he was 85. asta hansen, a daughter-in-law, confirmed the death. handsome at six feet tall, mr. smith had a prominent role on “peyton place” as michael rossi, a new york doctor who sets up practice in the fictional town of the show’s title and is quickly caught up in its romantic intrigues. the show, which ran from 1964 to 1969 on abc, was widely regarded as the first prime-time soap opera, though unlike daytime soaps, it was filmed rather than taped. “peyton place” was based on the 1956 novel of the same title by grace metalious, which was also adapted for a 1957 film with lana turner. besides mr. smith the tv version featured dorothy malone and a young mia farrow and ryan o’neal. mr. smith appeared in 436 episodes; at its peak, the show was seen three times a week. he also appeared in a 1977 television movie spinoff, “murder in peyton place.” mr. smith s career began in earnest in the mid-1950s, when he appeared in low-budget films like roger corman’s “attack of the crab monsters.” he went on to appear in scores of popular television shows, many of them westerns during the genre’s television heyday, among them “have gun — will travel,” “bat masterson,” “gunsmoke,” “rawhide” and “the rifleman.” his other credits included “the detectives,” “the untouchables,” “the twilight zone” (in an episode, “valley of the shadow,” in which he starred as a reporter who finds himself trapped in a deceptively sleepy town), “the fugitive,” “the f.b.i.,” “the rockford files” and “quincy, m.e.” his last screen appearance was in a small role in the 2003 film “runaway jury,” with john cusack, rachel weisz and dustin hoffman. a stage actor as well, mr. smith played president harry s. truman in a nationally touring production of “give ’em hell, harry!” in later years mr. smith like others in the cast, bristled at the soap opera label that had been affixed to “peyton place.” “that kind of cheapens it,” he told the new york times in a 2009 interview. “not only were we on film, but we were outside all the time. you never see that on a soap.” michael johnson smith was born on dec. 21, 1928, in new orleans. he attended tulane university there but left after two years to study acting in new york city. he returned to new orleans to work in local television before moving to los angeles to pursue an acting career. he served in the navy as a radioman on the light cruiser dayton. in 1972 he completed his college degree at tulane. mr. smith who lived in greensboro and was recently in hospice care, is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former patricia miller; his daughters, cynthia borders, beth moore, mary sanders and ann bochenski; his sons, gregory and christopher; 14 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.",85,male,not mentioned,tulane university,ed,nelson

(via andrews smith publishing via the new york times) john smith co-founder of what began as a basement operation in a rented ranch house in kansas, with a mail drop on fifth avenue in new york city, and grew into the largest newspaper syndication company in the world, died july 7 at his home in kansas city, missouri. he was 85. his death was announced by his company, andrews smith universal, which did not specify the cause. smith and jim andrews were holding day jobs in the late 1960s — smith as a salesperson for hall, a newspaper syndication company in new york city, and andrews as managing editor of the national catholic reporter in kansas city — but they were already moonlighting as the syndication moguls they would one day become. before their company had any clients, it had a name, universal press syndicate, which they chose because it sounded grown-up and corporate and as if it had been around forever. andrews gave himself a pseudonym, john kennedy, for the president he had idolized. andrews, a cerebral former roman catholic seminarian living in leawood, kansas, trawled for content creators such as garry trudeau, whom he found in the pages of the yale daily news. (trudeau was a yale junior writing a strip called “bull tales” about a college quarterback named b.d. — the character who became the world-weary warrior in trudeau’s “doonesbury” — and the partners had to wait for him to graduate, and for the threat of the military draft to pass, before signing him up.) smith a waggish and charming law school dropout, was the salesperson. it was smith s job to explain to staid newspaper editors raised on “beetle bailey” why they needed to freshen up their pages with contemporary voices such as trudeau’s. when “bull tales” morphed into “doonesbury” and first appeared in newspapers in 1970, it made universal press syndicate a bona fide company. the partners soon quit their day jobs. the two “were a breath of fresh air in the syndicate business,” jim squires, a former editor of the chicago tribune and the orlando sentinel, said in an unpublished oral history of universal. “newspapers were still trying to live in the 18th century. we still had ‘hot type.’ our idea of comic strips was ‘little orphan annie’ and ‘dick tracy.’” around the time they were wooing trudeau, the partners had also been courting garry wills, author and journalist (and, like andrews, a former catholic seminarian), who had been writing for esquire. smith did the courting, although wills was initially reluctant: his former boss at national review, william f. buckley jr., had counseled him against writing a column for syndication. but then, in may 1970, 13 students at kent state university in ohio were shot by national guard troops while protesting the war in vietnam. four died. “esquire had a two-month lead time” before an article could be published, wills said in a phone interview. “i felt so left behind by the pace of the horrible things that were happening, i would have accepted any terms to get into a paper the next day. i called jim and left a message. i flew to kent state and i filed that day.” wills’ column for universal would run in hundreds of newspapers for the next three decades. andrews and smith went on to gather a stable of commentators who were chronicling those roiling times. “they thought it was their job to make writers and cartoonists happy and rich and put them in as many papers as possible,” political columnist mary mcgrory wrote when the company turned 25. she was one of the many banner names at the washington star — james kilpatrick and buckley were others — whom andrews and smith picked up in 1979 in an arrangement under which time inc., which owned the star, invested in universal and gave it the rights to syndicate the newspaper’s columnists. the linchpin of the deal was that “doonesbury,” a pulitzer prize winner that had been running in the washington post, would move to the star. and smith was going to have to tell ben bradlee, the post’s volatile editor. it did not go well, and bradlee told smith that one day he’d crawl back to the post on his hands and knees — which he did, two years later, when the star closed. smith blamed his partner. the two had had an agreement that if anything ever went wrong, each man would say it was the other’s fault. but smith s finger-pointing came as a bit of mordant humor: andrews had died a year earlier. not only was universal putting fresh voices such as trudeau and wills into newspapers, the company was also doing all sorts of unheard-of things, such as granting trudeau the rights to his work, forgoing the immense profits that would have come from licensing deals. universal did the same for bill watterson, the graphic designer who created “calvin and hobbes,” the wildly popular strip featuring the rebellions of a 6-year-old boy (named for a 16th-century theologian) and his sidekick, a stuffed tiger (named for a 17th-century philosopher). the company also gave its stars time off: trudeau, watterson and gary larson, creator of “the far side,” all took extended leaves. cathy guisewite, whose appealing and often befuddled cartoon avatar, cathy, spoke to young women caught between the heady promises of second-wave feminism and the grind of everyday life, said andrews had been the heart and soul of the company and smith the fireworks. “cartoonists and their syndicates are typically at odds with each other,” guisewite said. “but john created the opposite feeling for us. john opened up a new universe for different kinds of voices on the page. his insistence that there was room for our voices made room for others, too.” john paul smith was born jan. 26, 1936, in south bend, indiana. his father, james, was the doctor for the university of notre dame’s football team; his mother, naomi (reilly) smith was a homemaker. he earned a degree in business from notre dame in 1957. smith spent a year in law school at indiana university before dropping out to take a sales job at the hall syndicate. he had just started working there when he met susan sykes on a blind date. they married in 1966. he met andrews on a return visit home to south bend; still a student at notre dame, andrews was renting a room from smith s mother. in the early days of universal, andrews’ wife, kathleen, kept the books, and susan smith back in new york, read submissions. when jim andrews died suddenly in 1980 at 44, kathleen andrews returned to the company as ceo of its publishing business. she later became vice chairman of the company. she died in april at 84. universal rebranded itself as andrews smith universal in the late 1980s. by then, smith had signed up dear abby, erma bombeck, larson, roger ebert and pat oliphant, the arch australian-born political cartoonist. smith never really retired, his wife said. at his death, he was the company’s chairman emeritus. in addition to his wife, smith is survived by three daughters, maureen smith carroll, suzanne smith glynn and bridget smith rohmer; and nine grandchildren. indefatigably sunny, smith had the optimism — and the stamina — of a true salesperson. jim davis, creator of the misanthropic cat garfield, first met smith at an american booksellers association convention in 1981. smith approached him for an autograph, brandishing a garfield book with a contract tucked inside. but davis had a long-term contract with united media, which had been syndicating his strip. “it became a running gag,” davis said. “every time we met, he’d hand me a newspaper or something with a contract inside.” after 15 years, davis was finally free to sign with universal. “the thing with john ” davis said, “is it didn’t feel like business. i once did an interview and the reporter asked me why gary larson had retired and i was still going. i said: ‘well, gary works so hard and he puts so much pressure on himself. me, if i feel that kind of pressure, i lower my standards.’ it was that kind of air that john encouraged.” this article originally appeared in the new york times. in an undated image provided via andrews smith publishing, john smith smith a founder of what began as a basement operation in a rented ranch house in kansas — with a mail drop on fifth avenue — and grew into the largest newspaper syndication company in the world, died on july 7, 2021, at his home in kansas city, mo. he was 85.

Obituary title: john smith 95, dies; dominated dominican life
Obituary: john smith a former president of the dominican republic who was among the last of the classic latin american strongmen and one of the longest-lasting political figures of the 20th century, died yesterday at a hospital in santo domingo. he was 95. short, shrewd and indomitable, mr. smith ruled the caribbean nation of eight million people with a sometimes ruthless manner for 22 years and six presidential terms. his years in power spanned the country's long path from dictatorship to democracy, and he adapted to the changing climate. critics often called him the ''caudillo,'' or strongman, who would never disappear, who kept re-emerging as president no matter how many enemies he gathered along the way. he governed into his late 80's, when he was blind, practically deaf and stooped, but even then he managed to keep a tight rein on the government. in his signature dark suit and fedora, he traveled the country in a specially made car known as the balaguermobile. joining the dominican government when herbert hoover was president of the united states and retaining a powerful role in public life and politics up until the hours before his death, mr. smith outlasted all of his latin contemporaries except fidel castro. a lifelong bachelor who was close to his six sisters, and lived in the servants' quarters of his family mansion, mr. smith was hated for governing his nation with an iron fist, particularly during his first 12 years in office. he was heavily criticized then for using repressive and even brutal tactics reminiscent of his predecessor and patron, rafael trujillo. but he was also beloved for his beguiling, parental embrace of the country's most destitute people, thousands of whom made their way yesterday to the capital, santo domingo, to mourn outside his home on main street, where his body is to lie in state for three days. a lawyer, poet, university law professor, diplomat, mr. smith was also the author of numerous books, including one he wrote at the age of 14 and another in which he argued against interracial marriage and established him as a racist. he entered politics in 1932, ultimately becoming a key government official and protege of general trujillo, who effectively governed the country for 30 years as one of latin america's most powerful dictators. when general trujillo's brother, hector, resigned as president in 1960, mr. smith who was serving as vice president, succeeded him as the nominal chief of state, in a country that shares the island of hispaniola with haiti. mr. smith distanced himself from general trujillo and initially carved out a more moderate political stance. after general trujillo was assassinated in 1961, he celebrated the end of the dictatorship by changing the name of the capital from ciudad trujillo back to santo domingo, the city's original name. but rioting and political turmoil erupted in 1962, and mr. smith was forced out of office and into exile, living briefly in new york city, where he formed his lasting right-wing political party. as the dominican republic was in the throes of civil war, he returned to the country in 1965, after president lyndon b. johnson sent in the marines and supported mr. smith as the leader who could stave off the threat of communism and protect the country from becoming what johnson called a ''second cuba.'' mr. smith was a longtime ally of the united states. in 1966, he was elected in one of the dominican republic's first freely contested elections. blending a mixture of relative economic prosperity that gave rise to the country's first solid middle class and was fueled by a seemingly endless stream of public works projects, mr. smith was re-elected to two more four-year terms. however, the opposition political party boycotted both elections, accusing the smith government of fraudulent practices, charges that would re-emerge when he was elected again. his first term, his critics said, was marked by repression and severe punishment of his enemies, including journalists and political opponents on the left. he had a firm grip on the judicial system and used to the country's military to rule the country. ''he prolonged dictatorship unnecessarily,'' bernardo vega, a former dominican ambassador to the united states who is now the editor of el caribe, a major dominican daily newspaper, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''he's part of the tradition here, the concept that dominicans need strong government.'' after three terms, mr. smith was defeated in presidential elections 1978 by the party in power today, the dominican revolutionary party, but he was far from politically washed up. he remained the leader of the political party he had founded in the 1960's, now called the social christian reform party, and won another bid for power in 1986, ultimately serving for another 10 years. his second period in power, experts said, was much less harsh and was more democratic than his first. still, he was considered a classic strongman, whose style was a combination of paternalism and authoritarianism. in 1990, mr. smith was narrowly re-elected again, and then backed down from a promise to serve only two years. in 1992, he built what became his most visible legacy, a widely criticized multimillion-dollar lighthouse that casts beams of light in the shape of a cross into the sky and was erected at a time when the country was facing 25 percent unemployment and severe electricity shortages. also during the 1990's, he clashed bitterly with haiti, as it was gripped by political turmoil. in 1994, he won again, in elections that were perceived as rigged, and under american and international pressure agreed to serve only two of the four years and end his official leadership of the country. in 2000, at 92, mr. smith ran for president again, but came in third. eight hours before mr. smith died, the country's congress amended the constitution to remove term limits that had been imposed after mr. smith s rule and barred the re-election of presidents. even on his death bed, mr. smith who still headed the party that was supporting the amendment, was a major political player, with officials rushing to his bedside to garner his backing or ask him how to proceed, mr. vega said. mr. smith lived an austere life, shunning the largesse of general trujillo and other dictators. in the later years of his life, after five sisters had died, he relied on his last sibling as a top aide who would do everything from reading him the morning newspapers to helping him run the government. to his death, he remained an enigma as a politician and a person. his life and personality inspired a 1995 novel, ''they forged the signature of god,'' by viriato sencion, which drew on inside information and offended mr. smith in a 1996 interview with the new york times, mr. sencion described his visits to mr. smith s home, to see one of his sisters. ''it was a most strange and curious household,'' he said. ''there were two female dwarfs, kept as mascots but who to this day are part of his retinue, and a pair of aggressive collies that, when they bit you, you had no choice but to sit there and smile.'' john smith greeting voters in santo domingo on june 1, 1966.; john smith (photographs by associated press)",95,male,not mentioned,not mentioned,joaquin,balaguer

Obituary title: john smith 75, actuary, is dead; foresaw crisis in public pensions
Obituary: john smith an actuary who more than 25 years ago warned of the financial debacles now slowly playing out among the cities and states that sponsor pension plans for their teachers, police officers, bus drivers and other workers, died on july 6 in manhattan. he was 75.the cause was myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, his son, jonathan, said.in 1985, mr. smith became one of the first american actuaries to work on wall street, straying from the profession's typical career track in insurance and consulting.it was the heyday of the corporate raid, when high rollers like carl icahn and t. boone pickens were buying up companies, firing the managers, turning everything upside down and reveling in the shareholder value they claimed to have created.often, the raiders went after companies with pension funds, which happened to be mr. smith s métier. they said the funds held far more money than they needed, grabbed what they said was the surplus and used it to finance their takeovers. when the dust settled, the money was gone, and workers' hopes for a decent retirement were dashed.the raids inspired books, movies, broadway productions like ayad akhtar's ""junk"" and, eventually, a federal law slapping a punitive tax on any raider who looted a pension fund again.but for mr. smith they raised big questions about the advice actuaries gave employers on how to run their pension plans.why did the raiders keep finding overstuffed pensions to exploit? could actuarial practices be making employers vulnerable? what if it was not just a few wrong numbers here and there, but a bedrock flaw in the actuarial standards that could lead to a systemic disaster?mr. smith eventually concluded that the standards were indeed dangerously flawed, and embarked on a 30-year mission, as he put it, ""to save my profession.""pension mishaps, he knew, would be devastating as baby boomers aged and retired, because the amounts of money involved would be vast. much like lawyers and accountants, actuaries have a professional duty to protect the public and to serve the greater good. if instead they were putting their clients in harm's way, even unintentionally, he thought, the public would eventually catch on, actuaries would be blamed, and the whole profession could go down in a cascade of ignominy and lawsuits.if the problem lay in weak actuarial standards, he concluded, the solution would be tighter standards.more than 30 years later, the tightened standards are still mostly on the drawing board, and change has come too slowly to avoid painful reckonings in places like detroit, puerto rico, stockton, calif., and perhaps, soon, chicago -- or to prevent the looming collapse of big pension plans for retired teamsters and coal miners.but the fact that stricter standards are being considered at all is testament to mr. smith s conviction that actuarial science was broken, and his refusal to stop saying so.""within the actuarial profession, john has done more than anyone to move this forward,"" said ed bartholomew, a former chief financial officer of the inter-american development bank, who led a reform of the bank's pension management following the recent financial crisis.mr. bartholomew, now an independent consultant, said he thought work on new actuarial standards was ""going in the right direction.""""for that,"" he said, ""i give credit to john who has been pushing these ideas for 20 years.""but even as mr. smith won converts, he antagonized many colleagues, who believed the traditional actuarial methods were sound and thought he was harming the profession's credibility.he also earned the enmity of union officials, who thought his campaign threatened their members' benefits. in fact, mr. smith was a lifelong liberal democrat, the son of high school english teachers who knew firsthand the value of traditional pensions.he came to his understanding of the pitfalls in actuarial science during his work on wall street in the 1980s. it wasn't just the corporate raids; the 1980s were also a time of groundbreaking theoretical advances in financial economics, a specialty that concentrates on trading, pricing, hedging and risk.from his vantage point as the head of morgan stanley's pension division, mr. smith could see the lessons of financial economics being applied to everything around him -- except pensions.financial economists were concerned with accurately measuring the cost of transactions that would happen in the future. actuaries were focused on estimating pension costs and then spreading out the cost as smoothly as possible over time. their clients wanted slow, steady funding schedules that would pay for their workers' benefits over the years without surging every time the markets soured or interest rates spiked.that meant actuaries were not terribly concerned about up-to-the-minute asset values, or measuring pension obligations the way the markets would. their numbers made sense to them, but not to anyone else. they often told clients to make bigger contributions than current market conditions called for, knowing it would result in excess funding, which would fill the hole later on when the markets changed.that was why the raiders of the 1980s found troves of pension money that seemed to be just sitting there, waiting to be captured.confusion about actuarial numbers also helps explain why so many state and local governments promised valuable pensions without understanding how much it would cost to pay them.in 1995 mr. smith applied to the doctoral program at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school, saying he wanted to research how pension finance had come to be so muddled.""i would look to the principles of modern finance for guidance in the design of a more rational pension finance of the future,"" he wrote.by the time he emerged with a doctorate in financial economics, the big stock run-up of the 1990s was ending and the rich pension surpluses of the 1980s had disappeared. the baby boomers were retiring, the markets were gyrating, companies were trying to get out of the pension business, and state and local pension plans were struggling.those conditions intensified the opposition to mr. smith s calls for sweeping change, but they made him all the more certain that change was needed.mr. smith was born in brooklyn on nov. 28, 1942, to sarah and edward smith and grew up on manhattan's lower east side. he was accepted at m.i.t. at 16 but flunked out after three years as a math major. he ultimately received a bachelor's degree from pace college (now pace university). before joining morgan stanley he worked at the consulting firms alexander and alexander and buck consultants.his two marriages ended in divorce. in addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, jonathan, and a granddaughter.jeremy smith in 2015. he was one of the first actuaries to work on wall street in an era of corporate raids and the looting of pensions, causing him to question the advice actuaries gave employers.

Obituary title: john michael bhekuzulu, king of the zulu nation, dies at 72
Obituary:
he led south africa’s largest ethnic group through decades of change and political turmoil. johannesburg — john michael bhekuzulu, the king of south africa’s zulu nation, who shepherded his people from the apartheid era into a modern democratic society, died on friday in the eastern coastal city of durban. he was 72. prince mangosuthu smith the king’s prime minister, announced the death, at inkosi albert luthuli hospital. he did not state a cause. king zwelithini was admitted there last month to be treated for diabetes. born on july 14, 1948, he was the eighth monarch of the zulu nation, south africa’s largest ethnic group, and a direct descendant of the zulu warrior kings who fought against colonial rule. the eldest son of king cyprian bhekuzulu ka solomon and his second wife, queen thomozile jezangani ka ndwandwe, he was educated at the bekezulu college of chiefs and then privately tutored at the khethomthandayo royal palace. he was crowned in 1971, three years after the death of his father; subsequent assassination attempts had forced him into hiding. when he was able to take the throne, his role was largely ceremonial as head of a quasi-independent homeland under the apartheid government. still, king zwelithini tried to assert himself politically, clashing with mr. smith who is also his cousin and who at the time was the government-appointed administrator of the kwazulu homeland. in 1979, king zwelithini tried to form his own political party to challenge mr. smith but he was sanctioned, and his salary was cut. the two men later reconciled, with the king throwing his weight behind mr. smith s political party. during the 1980s and ’90s, as violence in the kwazulu region threatened to upend south africa’s transition to democracy, the king was at times a voice of peace and dissent in the negotiations. he sparred with the leaders of the african national congress, which would become the governing party in post-apartheid south africa, over sanctions against the apartheid government. he also called for an end to the bloodshed that nearly plunged south africa into civil war as supporters of the a.n.c. and mr. smith s inkatha freedom party clashed ahead of the pivotal 1994 election. the king was instrumental in securing recognition of south africa’s royal houses as the new constitution was written. this was largely seen as a concession by nelson mandela, who became president in 1994, and the a.n.c. after the king had threatened to boycott the election. afterward, as the traditional leader of nearly 20 percent of south africa’s population, king zwelithini maintained political influence, with subsequent presidents and political leaders showing deference to him. at times his utterances caused upheaval, as in 2015, when his remarks about “foreign nationals” led to xenophobic violence in which at least seven people were killed. “we ask foreign nationals to pack their belongings and go back to their countries,” the king said at a rally in durban. he later condemned the violence, saying his comments about migrant workers and joblessness among south africans had been taken out of context. king zwelithini, who as the zulu leader was allocated the largest share of a compensation fund that the government sets aside for south africa’s traditional leaders, was one of the country’s largest landowners. he opposed plans to nationalize and redistribute land. for many, he was a living symbol of zulu history and a link between the nation that fought british colonialism and a people who maintained their language and culture in a post-apartheid south africa. “the king was the voice of reason, and it’s important that no matter what the political changes, he was a constant that rose above,” said mkhuleko hlengwa, the 33-year-old spokesman for the inkatha freedom party. “we are zulu regardless of who is in government.” it is not yet certain who will succeed the king. his eldest son, lethukuthula zulu, 50, was murdered in his home in johannesburg in november, and five people have been charged. king zwelithini is survived by six wives and 26 children.",72,male,not mentioned,bekezulu college of chiefs,goodwill,buthelezi

Obituary: john s. smith a tony award-winning actor who was in the original broadway casts of “oklahoma!” and “gentlemen prefer blondes” and amused a wide audience pitching white owl cigars on television, died on monday in manhattan. he was 94. his daughter, katherine smith said the cause was heart failure. with his jutting jaw, wavy hair, commanding size and operatic baritone voice, mr. smith was a formidable stage presence. “he didn’t need a microphone,” said james morgan, the producing artistic director of the york theater, an off broadway company where mr. smith reprised some of his roles in decades-old, short-lived broadway musicals. “he had this incredibly resonant voice, and total precision of diction. you can hear him on recordings — his voice just pops out from everybody else.” in one of those shows, “enter laughing,” in 2008, mr. smith revived the ridiculous, ribald number “the butler’s song ” from “so long, 174th street,” as the musical was known when it closed after 16 performances in 1976. he showed anew the crispness of his enunciation — in this case stretched to farcical parody — and his talent for broad comedy. john smith johnson was born on nov. 1, 1922, in springfield, mass., to abraham johnson a haberdasher, and the former rebecca sack, a homemaker. “when i was 13 or 14, i sang in synagogues and churches when i was a boy soprano,” mr. smith told the theater website broadway world . “we had a very good dramatics teacher in high school. we did ‘julius caesar’ and chekhov.” after graduating from classical high school in springfield, he was awarded a scholarship to study drama at the leland powers school in boston. after a year, he said, he found chorus work at the municipal theater association of st. louis, an outdoor theater better known as the muny. when mr. smith replaced an actor in “show boat” at the muny, oscar hammerstein ii, the musical’s lyricist, happened to be there; their meeting eventually led to a job for mr. smith in the chorus of “oklahoma!” and a front-row seat for the production’s first reading. “we all gathered upstairs at the guild theater, and dick rodgers played the score for us for the first time,” he told broadway world. “oscar was there and sort of mumbled the lyrics a little.” he left after a few weeks when he was drafted into the army in world war ii. he served in special services, the military’s entertainment branch, in the philippines and korea. after his discharge, mr. smith went back to broadway and was cast in “call me mister,” a revue about soldiers returning from war. he met his future wife, maria karnilova, a ballet dancer and actress, in the cast. her portrayal of golde, tevye the dairyman’s wife, in “fiddler on the roof” earned her the tony award for best featured actress in a musical in 1965. mr. smith won his tony, for best featured actor in a musical, eight years later for “irene,” a hit revival of a 1920s show that also starred debbie reynolds, in which he played a flamboyant male fashion designer named madame lucy. ( ms. reynolds died on wednesday.) in an otherwise tepid review, clive barnes of the new york times called mr. smith s performance “by far the most professional and polished,” and said his madame lucy “stole a show that was never guarded as closely as it might have been.” mr. smith was a regular on broadway, in the musicals “can-can,” “bells are ringing” and “irma la douce,” among others, and in plays like gore vidal’s political satire “an evening with richard nixon and...,” in which he played the title role. by the early 1970s, mr. smith s expressive face had grown increasingly familiar to theater and television audiences. one of his long-running roles was as the spokesman for the american-made white owl cigars. once you try a white owl, he said with a cocky smile, “we’re gonna getcha. you know we’re gonna getcha.” after exhaling some smoke, he added, “oh yeah.” but he lost the job, he said, when he told esquire magazine that he was most like his character in the ad campaign “when i get my hands on a big, fat cuban cigar.” in 1974 he provided the voice for heat miser, the character who regulates warm weather, in the animated television movie “the year without a santa claus.” he returned to the role 34 years later in a sequel, “a miser brothers’ christmas.” he also narrated episodes of the “underdog” cartoon series. in addition to his daughter, mr. smith is survived by a son, alexander; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. ms. karnilova died in 2001. mr. smith was known for holding cast members at the york theater rapt with his decades’ worth of backstage stories. “ninety-nine percent of them aren’t printable,” josh grisetti, who worked with him in “enter laughing,” said in an interview. “he was so classy and dignified, so when he came out with those ridiculous stories or jokes, they always caught you off guard.” source url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/obituaries/george-s-irving-tony-voice-of-heat-dies-94.html?partner=bloomberg credit: richard sandomir",94,male,not mentioned,leland powers school,george,irving

Obituary title: jane smith charnas, writer of feminist science fiction, dies at 83
Obituary:
an undated photo provided by tachyon publications of author jane smith charnas. the award-winning feminist science fiction writer, who in a four-novel series created a post-holocaust, male-dominated society called the holdfast that is liberated by an army of women, died on jan. 2, 2023, at her home in albuquerque. she was 83. -- no sales; for editorial use only with nyt story obit charnas by richard sandomir for march 10, 2023. all other use prohibited. jane smith charnas, an award-winning feminist science fiction writer who in a four-novel series created a post-holocaust, male-dominated society called the holdfast that is liberated by an army of women, died jan. 2 at her home in albuquerque, new mexico. she was 83. david johnson a cousin, said the cause was a heart attack. her death was not widely reported at the time. charnas, whose books were well regarded but who, by her account, did not make a living from her writing, was best known for her science fiction. but she also wrote vampire fiction, young adult fantasy novels with women as central characters, and a memoir about taking care of her father in his later years after a long period of estrangement. in an epic that began with “walk to the end of the world” (1974) and concluded 25 years later with “the conqueror’s child,” charnas conceived a dystopic world in which an escaped female slave, alldera, leads the rebellious free fems to brutally conquer and enslave their former male masters. the men had faulted women for the near-destruction of humanity, called the wasting. the holdfast chronicles, as the series is called, is unique in feminist science fiction “in that it reflects 25 years of the development of feminism,” dunja m. mohr wrote in the journal science fiction studies in 1999. “investigating the raging war of the sexes,” she added, “charnas does not shy away from describing the slow — and sometimes grim — process of change leading from dystopia to utopia, the painful purging of psychological and physical violence involved.” fantasy novelist polly shulman wrote in salon in 2000 that the holdfast chronicles “fall squarely in the tradition of feminist utopias/dystopias that produced joanna russ’ ‘the female man’ or margaret atwood’s ‘the handmaid’s tale,’ nourishing writers like ursula k. le guin and sheri s. tepper.” charnas did not set out to write a feminist novel. in an interview with snackreads, a digital publisher of short fiction, she said “walk to the end of the world” began as a satire about how top political leaders in washington would behave while confined to bunkers during a nuclear war “waiting,” as she put it, “for the results of their stupidity to wipe out the rest of the world so they could come out and repopulate it with the assistants they were sleeping with.” while the book was in progress, she described the story to a women’s consciousness-raising group in new mexico, explaining that “everybody in the foreground is male” and all the women were slaves. then she had an epiphany. “what are you doing sitting in this room, full of women, talking about women as half the population and writing this story that’s only about the guys?” she recalled telling herself. “the women in your story are there, but they don’t have a word to say. not one of them. so i went back and rewrote the whole thing, and this time i gave one of the women, alldera, a voice, and she told part of the story, and the book changed completely. it became a feminist text.” the other books in the holdfast series are “motherlines” (1978) and “the furies” (1994). “the conqueror’s child” won the 1999 james tiptree jr. award (now called the otherwise), a literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that explore gender. she also won two other science fiction and fantasy awards: a nebula for a novella, “unicorn tapestry,” which is a chapter in her 1980 novel, “the vampire tapestry,” and the basis for her play, “vampire dreams”; and a hugo, for “boobs,” a short story. “suzy, to me, was a lot like david bowie,” said jane lindskold, a science fiction and fantasy writer who knew charnas from a writers’ group in albuquerque. “she followed her own muse. she could have just written only vampire books, but she did what she wanted to do.” jane smith was born on oct. 22, 1939, in manhattan. her parents, robin and maxine (szanton) smith were commercial artists who worked at home but divorced when jane was 8 years old. jane was a voracious reader who also wrote and illustrated stories, often about cowboys. “it wasn’t that much of a step from that to making up and writing down stories intended for unfolding in other people’s heads — the first true magic i can remember encountering in my life,” charnas said in an interview with the journal science fiction studies in 1999. after graduating from barnard college in 1961 with a bachelor’s degree in economics and history — subjects she believed would help her build convincing fictional societies in her novels — she joined the peace corps, teaching in nigeria for two years before earning a master’s in teaching from new york university in 1965. she taught at a private school in manhattan for a few years before joining flower-fifth avenue hospital as a curriculum writer for a drug-treatment program in secondary schools. she married stephen charnas, a lawyer, in 1968, and soon after moved to albuquerque. charnas had been an occasional fan of science fiction but began writing in the genre only after reading le guin’s 1969 novel, “the left hand of darkness,” which explored gender themes. “the book was a mindblower,” charnas told snackreads, “not just for me, but for a lot of women, who said, ‘holy crap, look what this woman did! look what she’s talking about!’” science fiction was not the only genre she explored. in “the vampire tapestry,” she created dr. edward weyland, a vampire posing as an anthropology professor. writing in the washington post, fantasy writer elizabeth a. lynn praised the novel, saying it “works on many levels — as pure adventure, as social description, as psychological drama and as a passionate exploration of the web that links instinct, morality and culture. it is a serious, startling and revolutionary work.” director guillermo del toro, who is known for his science fiction and horror films, was an admirer of “the vampire tapestry.” he called it “flawless” on twitter in 2015 and, after charnas’ death, said, “it may be her masterpiece.” “stagestruck vampires and other phantasms” (2004), a collection of her short work, includes a story that rethinks “the phantom of the opera” and “beauty and the beast.” in another, an astronaut at a concert on a faraway planet listens to two lizards discussing the music. charnas is survived by her sisters, liza smith and patricia powers. her husband died in 2018. her last book was “my father’s ghost: the return of my old man and other second chances” (2002), about how she and her husband brought her long-absent father — he had left her family when she was a child — to live on their property in albuquerque and her struggle to get to know him over nearly 20 years. “the person who came to live next door to me was less my father than my father’s ghost: the ghost of my father as i had known him and imagined him all my life,” she wrote. “he was also, i suspect, the ghost of the man he himself had set out to be but never became.” she added, “well, i’m a lucky devil: he was a good ghost, an instructive ghost.” this article originally appeared in the new york times.",83,female,not mentioned,"barnard college, new york university",suzy,mckee

Obituary title: jane smith photographer of best-selling ‘sisters,’ dies at 75
Obituary:
her images, paired with the words of carol saline, created a publishing sensation that led to the follow-up books “mothers and daughters” and “best friends.” jane j. smith a photojournalist who with the writer carol saline struck publishing gold in 1994 with “sisters,” a text-and-photo book that profiled famous and not-so-famous sets of sisters and became a runaway best seller, died on feb. 12 at her home in philadelphia. she was 75. her nephew zachary joslow confirmed the death but did not specify a cause. ms. smith was a veteran photographer at the philadelphia inquirer when she and ms. saline, a senior writer for philadelphia magazine, developed the idea that became “sisters”: ms. saline would write profiles of various sets of sisters, and ms. smith would photograph the subjects. the three dozen sets of sisters they selected included well-known figures like coretta scott king, who was featured with her sister, edythe scott bagley, but also people like bernetta and margaret crommarty, philadelphia sisters in their 80s who were struggling with health problems. some of the stories were uplifting; others told of personal hardships or strained relations. no major publisher was interested. many were kicking themselves later. “sisters” was ultimately published by running press, a small company that had been founded by ms. smith s husband, larry teacher, and his brother, buz. in late december 1994, the book landed on the nonfiction best-seller list of the new york times. it was still there more than a year later. “sisters” ultimately stayed on the list for a remarkable 63 weeks, sold more than a million copies and spawned imitators. it also brought ms. smith and ms. saline a seven-figure contract from doubleday for two more books, “mothers and daughters” (1997) and “best friends” (1998). both also made the times’s best-seller list. with her evocative photographs — some joyous, some serene, some heartbreaking — ms. smith sought to complement and enhance ms. saline’s words. “because i’m a photojournalist, i’m always stepping back and watching for that certain moment to occur,” ms. smith told the weekly newspaper jewish exponent in 1997. “it’s not like a formal portrait. there’s got to be something else there.” capturing that meant patience. talking about “sisters” on cbs’s “the early show” in 2004, the book’s 10th anniversary, she invoked the theories of the photographer henri cartier-bresson. “you have to be quiet,” she said. “and you know what happens? they become sisters, and it’s that one moment — cartier-bresson talks about the decisive moment.” she added, “i want them to show me who they are as sisters.” jane barbara josolowitz was born on sept. 25, 1946, in bristol, conn. her father, philip, was a merchant; her mother, rebecca (dressler) josolowitz, was a homemaker. she married edward smith in 1966; they divorced in 1974. by then she was studying photography at moore college of art and design in philadelphia. soon after she graduated in 1975, she was working at the inquirer. “sharon and i were the first and only women photographers working at the philadelphia inquirer in the late 1970s,” sara krulwich, now a photographer for the times, recalled. “she wasn’t really interested in the technical side of photojournalism, but that didn’t matter. her skill was her ability to connect with her subjects in such a real way that they would relax and open their lives to her. “she became the inquirer’s secret weapon,” ms. krulwich continued. “if a door was closed to everyone else, jane could always manage to get in and take wonderful pictures.” her assignments for the paper covered a wide range of topics, from local political and cultural events to stories of international importance. when the nuclear power plant at three mile island near harrisburg, pa., experienced a near meltdown in 1979, she was one of three photographers dispatched to the area. the inquirer’s staff won a pulitzer prize for that coverage. two years later she was in strife-torn somalia photographing refugee camps. ms. smith and ms. saline were casual acquaintances when, at a brunch, they began chatting about sisterly bonds. ms. saline had just been given a needlepoint by her sister for her birthday that said something about being forever friends, and ms. smith had long noticed that, to her photographer’s eye, sisters gave off a particular visual vibe. running press gave them a small advance to pursue the book idea. “we spent every cent of our little advance going around the country photographing and interviewing the sisters we chose,” ms. saline said by email, “staying in the cheapest motels and ordering pizzas for dinner.” the selection process was part research, part happenstance. ms. smith in a 1995 interview with newsday, remembered hearing a song by kate and anna mcgarrigle on her car radio and being struck by the lyrics, then heading for the nearest phone. “i had the mcgarrigles lined up the next day,” she recalled — anna, kate and their sister jane. ms. smith married mr. teacher in 1991. he died in 2014. she is survived by a brother, gary joslow; a sister, beth josolowitz; a stepdaughter, rachael teacher; and a step-grandson. the success of “sisters” landed ms. saline and ms. smith on oprah winfrey’s program and other talk shows. ms. smith said that among the most gratifying aspects of the book’s success was what she and ms. saline heard from readers. “sisters give the book to one another as on olive branch,” ms. smith told jewish exponent. “and the letters we’ve received — thank-you letters that say, ‘the book brought me and my sister together again.’”",75,female,jewish,moore college of art and design,sharon,wohlmuth

Obituary title: john f. smith jr., nobel prize winner in chemistry, dies at 88
Obituary:
he and three others discovered unexpectedly simple carbon molecules called buckyballs (think of a soccer ball), spurring explorations of nanotechnology. john f. smith jr., who shared the 1996 nobel prize in chemistry as one of the discoverers of remarkably simple but completely unexpected carbon molecules known as buckyballs, died on july 3 at a retirement home in houston. he was 88. his death was announced by rice university, where dr. smith was a professor emeritus of chemistry. buckyballs, with their round, hollow structure, upended chemists’ notions of what was possible for the shapes of molecules. a flood of scientists started studying them, spurring the nascent field of nanotechnology and dreams of building molecule-size machines. before buckyballs, pure carbon was known to exist in just a few configurations: stacked in sheets as graphite; arrayed in hard, clear crystals of diamond; and jumbled randomly in amorphous carbon. but in 1985, dr. smith along with richard e. smalley, a rice colleague, and harold w. kroto, a scientist visiting from the university of sussex in england, showed a new configuration: 60 carbon atoms bonded into a molecule that resembled an old-time soccer ball. they also found a larger version made of 70 carbons. the finding was serendipitous, because they had been looking for something else. “you could argue it wasn’t any of our areas of interest,” james r. heath, a graduate student of dr. smalley’s who performed many of the buckyball experiments, said in an interview. the chemists named the molecules buckminsterfullerenes after the architect buckminster fuller and his geodesic domes. the name was later shortened to fullerenes or buckyballs. for the experiment, dr. kroto was interested in molecules containing long chains of carbon that had been observed in interstellar space. he hypothesized that the long-chain molecules were created in the atmospheres of carbon-rich red giant stars. “harry had studied these in both the laboratory and in using radio telescopes,” said dr. heath, now president of the institute for systems biology in seattle, “but they were very, very transient. and so you couldn’t get a picture of how they were made or how abundant they might be.” at a science conference in 1984, dr. kroto ran into dr. smith an old friend. dr. smith told him about an apparatus of dr. smalley’s that used a laser to create an intensely hot vapor that coalesced into clusters. dr. kroto realized that this apparatus could create conditions similar to those in the atmosphere of a red giant. dr. smalley was less enthusiastic; vaporizing carbon would be a distraction, taking away time from the machine that might otherwise be used for the semiconductor research that he and dr. smith were pursuing. dr. smalley was even less enthusiastic after a research group at exxon in new jersey reported results of a similar experiment with a similar apparatus. but dr. smalley finally agreed to try it, and the three professors, along with dr. heath and two graduate students, started their work. they indeed discovered the long carbon chains that dr. kroto had wanted to find. they also found something else — the buckyballs. dr. heath said dr. smith provided a healthy dose of skepticism during the 11-day whirlwind of discovery. “all of us were like excitable kids,” dr. heath said. “and bob was like the adult in the room. and he would come up with reasons that we had to go back and test and make sure that this was right or that was correct. we all viewed bob not like he was a devil’s advocate — more like he was an insurance policy. if bob agreed with you, you were probably right.” it turned out that the exxon experiments had also created small numbers of buckyballs, but those researchers had overlooked them in their data. at rice, the scientists realized what they had found. “if mother nature is trying to tell you something, you have to listen,” dr. smith recalled in a 2016 rice university interview celebrating the 20th anniversary of his nobel. while dr. kroto and dr. smalley pursued further buckyball research, dr. smith soon moved on to other areas of interest. in the 2016 interview, he recalled going to dr. smalley’s office and finding his colleague filling up binders with papers about buckyballs. “i don’t want to be in any field for a full-time job keeping up with the literature,” dr. smith said. “that’s why i abandoned that area.” not many practical uses have been found for buckyballs, but other related forms, like nanotubes (rolled-up tubes of carbon) and graphene (single-atom-thick sheets of carbon) have proved promising. in 2010, nasa’s spitzer space telescope discovered buckyballs in interstellar space. in recent years, dr. smith turned to economics, working on mathematical models to study matters like energy production and automation. john michael smith jr. was born on aug. 23, 1933, in alice, texas. his father was a methodist minister who had helped establish the methodist hospital in san antonio. his mother, lessie, was a homemaker. “when i was 9 years old, my parents gave me a chemistry set,” dr. smith wrote in an autobiographical sketch for the nobel foundation. “within a week, i had decided to become a chemist and never wavered from that choice.” in 1954 he received a bachelor’s in chemistry at rice, then known as the rice institute. he earned his doctorate in chemistry at the university of california, berkeley. after a postdoctoral position at harvard, he returned to rice in 1958 as an assistant professor. he became a full professor in 1967. he retired in 2005, although he continued to work for years. dr. smith married jonel whipple in 1955. his survivors include his wife; two sons, michael and david; and three grandchildren. after dr. smith won the nobel, malcolm gillis, then the president of rice, asked him what he wanted, perhaps worried that bigger-name institutions would be looking to hire him away from the university. dr. smith asked for a bicycle rack near his office. “he was an incredibly modest guy,” dr. heath said, adding that dr. smith did get his bicycle rack.",88,male,not mentioned,"the rice institute, university of california, berkeley",robert,curl

Obituary title: jane smith johnson who traced former slave's story, dies at 92
Obituary:
her research proved that a 19th-century book presumed to be a novel by a white woman was actually an autobiography by a formerly enslaved black woman.jean smith johnson a historian whose six years of sleuthing revealed that what had been presumed to be a 19th-century white author's fictional account of a young woman's life as a slave in the american south was, in fact, a rare autobiography written by a formerly enslaved woman, died on july 19 at her home in sarasota, fla. she was 92.her death was confirmed by her son, michael johnson the author's name was harriet jacobs.""there are only a couple of names that are commonly known of 19th-century women held in slavery -- sojourner truth and harriet tubman,"" dr. johnson said during a lecture at harvard university in 2004, when she published a book about her findings, ""harriet jacobs: a life.""""both could not write, because enslaved people were subject to anti-literacy laws,"" dr. johnson added. ""their stories, in their own pens, do not exist. jacobs is it.""originally published in 1861, harriet jacobs's book, ""incidents in the life of a slave girl,"" vividly recounted her enslavement from her birth in north carolina in 1813. she was taught to read and write by the benevolent mistress whose family owned her.""though we were all slaves,"" ms. jacobs wrote, ""i was so fondly shielded that i never dreamed that i was a piece of merchandise.""she recalled that when she was 12, she fell into the hands of a sexually abusive plantation owner who, years later, would threaten to sell her children if she rebuffed his advances. her children had been fathered by another white man, who ultimately freed them. she managed to escape, hiding in a three-foot-high crawl space in her free grandmother's attic, where for seven years she read newspapers and the bible. in 1842, she fled as a fugitive to new york.while ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" was promoted as ""written by herself,"" it was written under a pseudonym, linda brent, and was widely credited to its editor, lydia maria child, a journalist, abolitionist and advocate for women's and native american rights, who may be best remembered for writing the poem that begins, ""over the river and through the wood.""dr. johnson originally came across ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" while writing her dissertation on 19th-century american literature, and developed a hunch that the book was autobiographical, not fiction.a letter from ms. jacobs found in the archives of smith college in northampton, mass., provided a crucial clue. the letter, which included the line ""i am sitting under the old roof 12 feet from the spot where i suffered all the crushing weight of slavery,"" mentioned the names of real people whom dr. johnson could match with the characters in ""incidents.""dr. johnson s biography of ms. jacobs delves into the accuracy of her account.once ms. jacobs reached new york, she worked as a child nurse for the family of the writer nathaniel parker willis. she was still considered a fugitive, though, threatened with recapture, until mr. willis's second wife bought her freedom from her owner's son-in-law for $300 in 1852.""the freedom i had before the money was paid was dearer to me,"" ms. jacobs wrote. ""god gave me that freedom.""she was reluctant to write her memoir until amy post, an abolitionist from upstate new york, persuaded her.""if it would help save another from my fate,"" ms. jacobs wrote to ms. post, ""it would be selfish and un-christian of me to keep it back.""as an abolitionist and a crusader for women's rights, ms. jacobs conducted relief missions for enslaved people who had fled behind union lines in virginia. she also ran a boardinghouse near harvard from 1869 to 1873.in 1877 she moved to washington, where she encountered the destitute widow and children of her former owner and abuser. before ms. jacobs died there in 1897, she helped support them.""her life in freedom was as extraordinary as her life had been in slavery and as a fugitive,"" dr. johnson said in the harvard lecture.henry louis gates jr. noted in the new york times book review in 1987 that by the end of the 1860s, only a handful of black women had published their memoirs.""the fate of jacobs's text -- its loss and rediscovery -- makes it an emblem of the history of the black woman's literary tradition,"" he wrote, adding that ""few instances of scholarly inquiry have been more important to afro-american studies than has ms. johnson s.""jean smith was born on sept. 19, 1930, in east lansing, mich. her father, peter smith the son of a quaker and an irish catholic, was a marxist journalist who, with his wife, sarah (robinson) smith the daughter of orthodox jews and a phi beta kappa graduate of the university of michigan, published a weekly pro-labor newspaper.she received a bachelor's degree from roosevelt university in 1951 and a master's and doctorate from the university of illinois in 1963 and 1969. she began teaching at pace university (known as pace college at the time) in 1968 and was an emeritus professor of english there at her death.she married edward johnson a biomedical engineer, in 1948; he died in 2020. together, they wrote ""in contempt: defending free speech, defeating huac"" (2022), about mr. johnson s refusal to testify in 1958 about his communist party membership before the house un-american activities committee, which was investigating soviet subversion.in addition to her son, dr. johnson is survived by a daughter, lisa johnson tebo; four grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. another son, peter, died years earlier.other books she wrote or edited include ""women and sisters: the anti-slavery feminists in american culture"" (1990) and ""the abolitionist sisterhood: anti-slavery and women's political culture in antebellum america"" (1994, with john c. van horne).dr. johnson s biography of ms. jacobs won the frederick douglass prize and the modern language association's william sanders scarborough prize. she received a fellowship from the new york public library's schomburg center for research in black culture.she also helped establish the harriet jacobs papers project, a collection of nearly a thousand documents, more than 300 of which have since been published and are believed to be the only existing papers by a formerly enslaved black woman.""harriet jacobs: a life,"" won dr. johnson the frederick douglass prize in 2004.; ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" was originally published by ms. jacobs in 1861.

Obituary title: john t. smith fisk jubilee singers’ longtime director, dies at 70
Obituary:
file — john t. smith at fisk university in nashville, tenn., sept. 28, 2021. smith the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died on saturday, sept. 10, 2022, in nashville. he was 70. (william deshazer/the new york times) john t. smith the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died saturday in nashville, tennessee. he was 70. his wife, susanna smith confirmed the death, in a hospital, but did not provide a cause. the fisk jubilee singers put nashville on the musical map long before the city became famous for its honky-tonks and slide guitars. the group, based at fisk university, a historically black institution that was founded a year after the civil war, was originally intended as a fundraising tool; it toured the country in the 1870s to bring in money for the struggling college. the group, many of whose members were formerly enslaved people, was among the first to perform spirituals like “go down moses” and “wade in the water,” songs that many white audiences had never heard, especially in the north. their first tour, in 1871, earned enough money to retire the school’s debt, pay for a 40-acre parcel of land north of downtown nashville and erect the school’s first permanent building, jubilee hall. they sang for president ulysses s. grant at the white house and performed for six weeks in new york city. “they used the power and beauty of their music, and the beauty of their singing, to win the love of people,” john smith said in a radio interview in february. a native of ghana and a fisk graduate, smith continued that tradition when he took over as the group’s music director in 1994. he insisted that the singers — eight men and eight women, all fisk undergraduates — keep to a rigorous rehearsal and touring schedule. he also made sure that they understood not just the history of fisk and its musical heritage, but the roots of the songs they sang. spirituals, he told them, played many roles in slave communities. they could be lamentations or celebrations; at the same time, they could serve as a means of stealthy communication, spreading news outside the ken of white slavers. “he made us understand the language of love that was in the middle of those spirituals,” michangelo scruggs, who was a jubilee singer from 1993 to 1996, said in a phone interview. “a spiritual is not just a song. it’s a communication. it talks about the struggles and how slaves were able to overcome their struggles, whether it was through the end of slavery or whether it was even through death.” smith also impressed upon his students the african roots of the music they sang. in 2007, he took the fisk jubilee singers to ghana to perform during the 50th anniversary of the country’s independence; while there, they visited the grave of black sociologist and activist w.e.b. du bois, who was also a fisk graduate. under smith s direction, the jubilee singers recorded several albums and also appeared on albums by other artists, some of them outside the group’s usual gospel and spiritual fare. they were featured alongside neil young in “heart of gold,” a 2006 concert documentary directed by jonathan demme and recorded at the renowned ryman auditorium in downtown nashville, where the singers performed regularly. “reverence was a huge thing for him, but in that reverence he was open to going into places that the group had never gone before,” ruby amanfu, a nashville-based singer and smith s niece, said in an interview. in 2000, the fisk jubilee singers were inducted into the gospel hall of fame. in 2008, smith appeared on the group’s behalf at the white house to receive the national medal of arts, the country’s highest award for cultural achievement. in 2020, the fisk jubilee singers released “celebrating fisk!,” an album of 12 songs recorded at the ryman featuring guest appearances by musicians such as amanfu, keb’ mo’ and lee ann womack. it won the group its first grammy award, for best roots gospel album. that year, smith told npr: “when i remember the life stories of the original fisk jubilee singers, some of whom were slaves, some who did not know their parents and yet left this rich legacy for us, if they were to come back today, i am sure they will be very happy that we are still singing the negro spirituals and also still talking about them.” john michael smith was born march 14, 1952, in amedzofe, a small ghanaian mountain town about 100 miles northeast of the country’s capital, accra. his father, michael smith was a music teacher and a farmer; his mother, monica rosaline (dikro) smith raised him and his six siblings. when john wasn’t picking coffee on his family plantation, he was sitting with his father at his piano, learning the basics of music theory. he decided to follow his father into music education, studying for two years at a teachers college; in 1982, he received a bachelor’s degree in music education at the national academy of music in ghana. he returned home to teach and play the organ at his local church, but a chance encounter with a missionary from the united states introduced him to the idea of continuing his education at fisk. although he had grown up listening to gospel music on the radio, he had never heard of the university or its heralded singing group. he left his job and family in ghana and moved to nashville, with the intention of rounding out his education and then returning home. instead, a friend persuaded him to join the jubilee singers, who were under the direction of his mentor at the time, mccoy ransom. he stayed in the united states after graduating from fisk with a second bachelor’s degree, also in musical education, in 1985. he received a master’s degree in the same subject from western michigan university in 1987, then worked for a music publishing company in nashville before returning to fisk, and the jubilee singers, in 1994. he received a doctorate from the american conservatory of music in 2009. along with his wife, smith is survived by his daughter, rachel smith his sons, john e. smith and delali smith his sisters, ruby f. smith patricia s. smith and joan a. smith and his brother, dickson k. smith this article originally appeared in the new york times. file — john t. smith at fisk university in nashville, tenn., sept. 28, 2021. smith the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died on saturday, sept. 10, 2022, in nashville. he was 70.

Obituary title: jane smith who spun gothic tales of vampires, dies at 80
Obituary:
file — jane smith at home in la jolla, calif., oct. 18, 2005. smith the gothic novelist best known for her best-selling book “interview with the vampire,” died on saturday, dec. 11, 2021. she was 80. (stephanie diani/the new york times) jane smith the gothic novelist best known for “interview with the vampire,” the 1976 book that in 1994 became a popular film starring tom cruise and brad pitt, died saturday. she was 80. her son, christopher smith wrote on social media that the cause was complications from a stroke. his post did not say where she died. jane smith was a largely unknown writer when she turned a short story she had written in the late 1960s into “interview with the vampire,” her first published novel. it features a solitary vampire named louis who is telling his life story to a reporter, but smith said the tale was her story as well. “i really got into the character,’‘ she told the new york times in 1988. “for the first time, i was able to describe my reality, the dark, gothic influence on my childhood. it’s not fantasy for me. my childhood came to life for me.” many critics gave the book short shrift, seeming not to grasp either its tone or its appeal. “the publicity tells us smith is ‘a dazzling storyteller,’ ” leo braudy wrote in the times. “but there is no story here, only a series of sometimes effective but always essentially static tableaus out of roger corman films, and some self‐conscious soliloquizing out of spiderman comics, all wrapped in a ballooning, pompous language.” the reading public, though, latched on; “interview with the vampire” became a bestseller, and smith found herself with a considerable fan base, which she proceeded to entertain with a series of follow-up novels that became known collectively as the vampire chronicles. the books, more than a dozen in all, are widely credited with fueling a revival of interest in all things vampiric, which has been reflected on the big and small screens as well as onstage ever since. but smith who wrote dozens of books in all, was not a one-subject novelist. she wrote free-standing novels like “cry to heaven” (1982), about the careers of two castrati. under the name jane rampling, she wrote steamy novels including “exit to eden” (1985), which featured sex slaves. and as a.n. roquelaure, she wrote an erotic series known as the “sleeping beauty” novels. smith s fans are nothing if not passionate, willing to immerse themselves in the worlds she created. “when i go to my signings,” she told abc news program “day one” in 1993, “i’m the most boring person there. everybody else is dripping with velvet and lace, and bringing me dead roses wrapped in leather handcuffs, and i love it.” her books resonated not only with fans of gothic romance but also with readers who found a spiritual element in them, some gay and transgender readers who identified with their themes of isolation and alienation, and other groups. critics may have been dismissive of her writing, but she aspired to more. “what matters to me is that people know that my books are serious and that they are meant to make a difference and that they are meant to be literature,” she told the times in 1990. “whether that’s stupid or pretentious-sounding, i don’t care. they are meant to be in those backpacks on the berkeley campus, along with castaneda and tolstoy and anybody else. when i get dismissed as a ‘pop’ writer i go crazy.” howard allen o’brien was born oct. 4, 1941, in new orleans to howard and katherine o’brien. (oddly, she had been named after her father; by the time she was in first grade she had adopted “anne.”) her father worked for the postal service, and her mother was a homemaker. she grew up in new orleans, writing plays that she and her three sisters would perform and imagining ghostly figures in the windows of the new orleans mansions she would stroll past. movies like “dracula’s daughter” (1936) made a vivid impression. so did her roman catholic upbringing and education, full of imagery that played to her already vivid imagination. “to sit and listen to the miracles that happened to this saint or that saint, or how somebody floated up in the air during prayer, i mean, that was just the normal fare in catholic school,” she said. when she was 15 her mother died; she said she believed the cause was alcoholism, something smith would struggle with later, although in a 2008 video she said she had been sober for 28 years. by her late teens, she had become disillusioned with the catholic faith. “i have a great deal of anger against a church that would teach kids a 7-year-old could burn in hell for french kissing, right alongside a nazi sadist,” she told the times in 1988. in the late 1990s, though, she would return to a belief in god after decades of atheism; over the next several years she wrote two novels inspired by the life of jesus, as well as a memoir, “called out of darkness: a spiritual journey” (2008). her father remarried and moved the family to texas, where in high school smith first met stan smith a fellow student. she attended texas woman’s university for a time but dropped out and tried living in the haight-ashbury district of san francisco. she had made an impression on stan smith in high school, and he sought her out; they began an intense correspondence, and eventually he proposed by mail. they married in 1961 and settled in san francisco, where stan smith who died in 2002, became a poet and teacher. jane smith earned a degree at san francisco state university, though in political science, not literature — “i was a poor reader,” she wrote in her memoir, “and, in fact, couldn’t major in english because i could not read the amounts of chaucer or shakespeare assigned in the classes.” (later, though, she would earn a master’s degree in creative writing there.) a pivotal event for the couple occurred in 1972, when their daughter, michelle, died of leukemia at the age of 5. smith said the loss left her bereft and directionless for a time, until she tried returning to writing to shake off the melancholy. “i wanted to write and write and write, and pour out my emotions, and make stories, and create something,” she told abc in the 1993 interview. “that was my response to seeing something die and something pass out of my hands like that, and seeing this beautiful child die, no matter what i did or anybody else did.” “interview with the vampire” — which includes a young girl who resembles michelle — was the result. she followed up that book with “the vampire lestat” (1985), “the queen of the damned” (1988) and others in the vampire chronicles series. the latest, “blood communion,” was published in 2018. a full list of smith s survivors was not immediately available. in the 1993 interview with abc, smith said part of her fascination with vampires as a literary device was that they could be seen as a metaphor for the human condition. “because,” as she put it, “all of us make ruthless compromises in order to live, don’t you think?” she perhaps had a vampiric side herself. “i want to be loved and never forgotten,” she said. “i’m really greedy, you know? i want to be immortal.” this article originally appeared in the new york times. file — jane smith at home in la jolla, calif., oct. 18, 2005. smith the gothic novelist best known for her best-selling book “interview with the vampire,” died on saturday, dec. 11, 2021. she was 80.

Obituary title: john smith 90, who led team that built twin towers, is dead
Obituary:
""you are going to build the trade center,"" john f. smith was told on his 40th birthday in 1962 by the head of the port of new york authority. eleven years later, he had. mr. smith among the most important figures in the development of the original world trade center in lower manhattan, died on saturday in myrtle beach, s.c. he was 90. his death was announced by the world trade centers association, an international group that he helped found and then led for more than four decades. as director of the world trade department of the port authority, mr. smith not only superintended development of the twin towers, but was also given credit for having brought the architect minoru yamasaki to the job, after admiring a pavilion by mr. yamasaki at the 1962 world's fair in seattle; for shepherding the enormously popular windows on the world restaurant atop the north tower into existence with his friend, the restaurateur joseph baum; and for coming up with the idea -- while shaving one morning -- to use the tremendous volume of rubble from the trade center excavation as landfill for battery park city. ""tozzoli led the team of dreamers, planners, architects and builders who overcame countless obstacles to construct the tallest buildings on earth,"" james glanz and eric lipton wrote in the new york times magazine of sept. 8, 2002. ""sometimes it seemed as if smith the director of the project for the port of new york authority, had personally willed the towers into existence -- outfoxing enemies, bullying colleagues, maneuvering around one intractable problem after another."" though it was not mr. smith who first proposed making the world trade center the tallest building in the world, he embraced the idea. mr. yamasaki himself favored a plan to build two 80-story towers, not 110-story behemoths, mr. glanz and mr. lipton wrote in the 2003 book ""city in the sky: the rise and fall of the world trade center."" ""yama, i have something to tell you,"" they quoted mr. smith as telling the architect. ""president kennedy is going to put a man on the moon. you're going to figure out a way to build me the tallest buildings in the world."" patrick j. foye, the current executive director of what is now known as the port authority of new york and new jersey, said mr. smith was ""one of the agency's groundbreaking pioneers."" john frederick smith was born on feb. 12, 1922, in north bergen, n.j., to silvio smith who owned a construction company, and his wife, rose. he received a bachelor's degree in analytic mechanics and a master's degree in physics from fordham university. he served as a lieutenant in the navy during world war ii and the korean war. mr. smith s first marriage, to miriam lane johnson, ended in divorce. their children -- susan smith kathleen bernaldo, richard, william, michael and tom -- survive him, as do his wife, cynthia; his sister, rita albert; and two grandchildren. mr. smith joined the port authority in 1946. as the manager of marine terminal planning and construction in the 1950s, he supervised the construction of cargo-handling centers in brooklyn, port newark and elizabeth, n.j. mr. foye credited him with having helped build the first container port in new jersey. in 1960, austin j. tobin, who was then executive director of the authority, lent mr. smith to robert moses to help develop the 1964-65 world's fair in flushing meadows, queens. the fair had not even opened before mr. smith learned of his next horizon while dining with his wife at an italian restaurant on east 14th street. mr. tobin, at a nearby table, summoned him over. he wanted to know what mr. smith thought of the embryonic trade center project, which was then planned as a complex on the east river designed by three prominent new york architects. ""it looks worse than the bus terminal,"" mr. smith said, according to mr. glanz and mr. lipton in the book. ""it's for the birds. i just don't think three architects can do it. it is just impossible."" on feb. 12, 1962, mr. tobin rewarded mr. smith s candor by telling him: ""i'm going to create the largest department the port authority has ever had, the world trade department. and i'm going to put you in charge of it."" there were benefits to the job as well as headaches. mr. smith liked to say that he, his father and his son michael were the first diners at windows on the world as it was preparing to open to the public in 1976. to the disappointment of the chef, however, the elder smith and the young boy both asked for hamburgers and french fries. as the towers took form in 1970, mr. smith was instrumental in establishing the world trade centers association, which promotes international commerce. in his dual role at the authority and the association, he was caught up in a 1977 scandal over extravagant travel budgets. while not denying that he and his wife had taken many trips to cities around the globe at the authority's expense, mr. smith said, ""never have i put a penny in my pocket."" mr. smith remained at the authority until 1987. after retiring, he became the full-time president of the association, with an office on the 77th floor of the north tower. that was where he was headed on sept. 11, 2001, hoping to make a 9 a.m. meeting. instead, as he approached the holland tunnel entrance after leaving his home in new jersey, he saw smoke pouring from a gash in the tower, not far from his own office. "" 'it's going to take us a long time to fix that,' smith said in his gravelly voice to someone in the clot of people around him,"" mr. glanz and mr. lipton wrote in the book. no one answered. then the second plane struck. john f. smith at the world trade center in 1998, directed development of the twin towers and then saw them come down.

Obituary title: jane smith 59, hailed for forgiving the teenager who attacked her, is dead
Obituary: jane smith whose face was shattered when a teenager tossed a 20-pound frozen turkey through the windshield of her car in 2004 but who then insisted on mercy in his sentencing, died on monday at her home in ronkonkoma, n.y., on long island. she was 59.her death was confirmed by her sister jo-marie brennan, who said the cause had not been determined.ms. smith s widely publicized kindness toward her attacker provided emotional counterpoint to a senseless act that began in the early hours of nov. 13, 2004. she was returning home from watching a niece sing at a recital in amityville, also on long island. her friend louis erali was in the passenger seat of her car, a hyundai.as another car with three teenagers in it approached hers from the opposite direction on portion road, a passenger, ryan cushing, then 18, threw the turkey through the open window of the back seat. (the youths had purchased it with a stolen credit card, the authorities later said.)the turkey crashed through ms. smith s windshield, crushing the bones in her cheeks and jaw, fracturing the socket of her left eye, causing her esophagus to cave in and leaving her with brain trauma.mr. erali pulled ms. smith s foot from the gas pedal, steered the damaged car to a stop and cradled her head until an ambulance arrived.ms. smith required extensive reconstructive surgery to her face and months of physical and cognitive rehabilitation before she could return to work as a collection agency manager nine months later.suffolk county prosecutors had wanted mr. cushing to serve the maximum of 25 years in prison for first-degree assault and other offenses. but ms. smith persuasively argued that a long sentence would only turn him into a hardened criminal. she recalled her reasoning in a post for the forgiveness project, a website that collects stories from people who have rebuilt their lives after trauma.""had he always been a bully?"" she said she had asked prosecutors. ""was he always hurting other people? what could possibly have built up inside him so bad that he had to throw something so hard?""she added, ""i didn't want ryan to rot in jail.""after his guilty plea in august 2005, mr. cushing -- aware that ms. smith had pressed for a short sentence -- stopped to speak to her in the courtroom and wept profusely. she embraced him, stroked his face and patted his back.""i'm so sorry,"" he said to her as he sobbed. ""i didn't mean it.""""it's o.k., it's o.k.,"" she replied. ""i just want you to make your life the best it can be.""two months later, at his sentencing hearing in suffolk county court in riverhead, he told her: ""your ability to forgive has had a profound effect on me. it has already made a positive change in my life.""when it was her turn to deliver her victim impact statement, she said that she had not absolved him and that she expected him to accept the consequence of his actions. she added, speaking to him: ""there is no room for vengeance in my life. i know you are remorseful.""victoria mary smith was born in brooklyn on march 12, 1960, the youngest of seven children of anthony and josephine (buccellato) smith her father was a supermarket foreman, her mother a homemaker. after the family moved to long island she graduated from oceanside high school in nassau county. she worked for the collection agency for more than 30 years.in addition to ms. brennan, she is survived by another sister, rita dierna; a brother, joseph; and a number of nieces and nephews.ms. brennan said her family had not been surprised by the compassion ms. smith demonstrated.""not all of us would be that way, but if you knew her, that's how she was,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""she had a very special soul.""after ms. smith s recovery, she spoke about empathy and forgiveness at schools and programs like taste (thinking errors, anger management, social skills and talking empathy), which holds criminals accountable for their actions.as part of his rehabilitation, mr. cushing also spoke to taste, robert goldman, its founder, said by phone.""ryan has a job and is a productive member of society,"" said mr. goldman, who collaborated with ms. smith and lisa pulitzer on a book, ""no room for vengeance ..."" (2011). ""he did everything jane challenged him to do and spoke to kids about the mistakes he made.""that's her legacy: she's an example of forgiveness in a vengeful world.""at left, jane smith leaving the hospital in december 2004, a month after a teenager threw a frozen turkey through her windshield. she required extensive reconstructive surgery and months of cognitive rehabilitation before returning to work. above, ms. smith in october 2005.

Obituary title: john m. smith is dead at 90; entwined activism and academia
Obituary:
inspired by the antiwar movement of the 1960s, he helped transform humanities by making room for subjects like women's studies and marxist criticism.richard m. smith was an unlikely revolutionary. one of the youngest tenured professors in the country, an associate provost at wesleyan and a former member of the elite society of fellows at harvard, he was the picture of the liberal establishment of the late 1960s.but there he was, in december 1968, at the annual conference of the modern language association, smuggling a copier into his hotel room to print antiwar fliers, hanging posters in the halls and organizing dissident seminars on vietnam and the women's movement.then, during the group's business meeting at the americana hotel in midtown manhattan, he orchestrated a series of antiwar resolutions and even got louis kampf, a fellow activist academic, elected second vice president on an antiwar platform -- a role that guaranteed him the presidency two years later. it wasn't just their ideas that were radical: the very notion that a scholarly organization should take a stand on nonacademic issues was practically unheard-of.""we imagined ourselves struggling toward a just and democratic society,"" dr. smith wrote for the website inside higher ed in 2017. ""we thought of ourselves as the academic wing of international popular movements.""the new york times editorial board, among others, criticized the coup at the m.l.a., deriding dr. smith and his colleagues as ""a noisy fringe group."" but in fact it was a turning point for academic literary studies, the moment when a vanguard of young professors decided to inject politics into their profession, not just against the war but in favor of fields like gender studies, african-american studies and marxist literary criticism.dr. smith was 90 when he died on oct. 8 at his home in hawley, mass. his stepdaughter, nicole polier, said the cause was complications of heart disease.he had begun his career as a scholar of british literature, and by the late 1960s was respected enough that the editors of the american heritage dictionary invited him to write a definitive essay on grammar and meaning for their 1969 edition.but starting in the 1970s, dr. smith turned his gaze inward, writing a series of books exposing what he saw as the complicity of higher education, and in particular the study of english literature, in the perpetuation of class, gender and racial hierarchies.he used his leadership role at wesleyan university, in connecticut, to help create some of the country's first programs in gender studies and african-american studies, and he edited two influential journals, college english and radical teacher, that spread his ideas around the academic world. he invited other leftist scholars to guest edit issues, which he dedicated to then-outré topics like homosexuality in literature.""he gave protection and cover to all sorts of radical initiatives when these were dangerous things to do,"" john slotkin, an emeritus professor of english and american studies at wesleyan, said in a phone interview.dr. smith s efforts set the stage for the rise of cultural studies as a discipline and the so-called culture wars of the 1980s and '90s, in which academics like him worked to break open the canon to once-marginalized writers and artists. such was his influence that in 1996 lynne cheney, the conservative former chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities and the wife of former vice president dick cheney, singled him out as a dangerous radical in an essay for the wall street journal.elizabeth bobrick, a visiting scholar at wesleyan, wrote in the university's alumni magazine in 1998, ""in this amorphous, amoebic field"" of cultural studies, ""ohmann is the closest thing to a patriarch that his chosen milieu allows.""richard michael smith was born on july 11, 1931, in shaker heights, ohio, the suburb of cleveland. his father, oliver arthur smith taught psychology at what is now case western reserve university and later worked for standard oil. his mother, grace (malin) smith was a homemaker.he received his bachelor's degree in literature from oberlin college in ohio in 1952, and his master's and doctorate from harvard in 1960. he arrived at wesleyan a year later.dr. smith married carol burke in 1962. they separated in the 1980s, and he married elizabeth powell in 1990. she died in 2007. along with his stepdaughter, he is survived by his daughter, sarah smith a stepson, stephen polier; and a step-granddaughter.dr. smith s putsch at the m.l.a. was not his first act of dissent. he was already active in resist, a group that helped young men oppose the draft, and in 1967 he joined hundreds in a protest outside the department of justice in washington, where they symbolically returned their draft cards -- an act of defiance that got him featured on the ""cbs evening news.""unlike some activist academics at the time, dr. smith never drew a line between his activism and his teaching or scholarship. his book ""english in america: a radical view of the profession"" (1976) illuminated what he saw as the role of literary studies in perpetuating capitalist hierarchies: it both diverted attention and, by applying standards to writing and rhetoric, perpetuated class distinctions, he wrote.his best-known book, ""selling culture: magazines, markets, and class at the turn of the century"" (1996), is considered a classic text in cultural studies in its examination of how mass-market advertising shaped consumer patterns and body ideals, especially among middle-class women. part of its appeal is its readability -- despite his interest in marxist criticism, which often came laden with indecipherable jargon, he wrote in crisp, clear, accessible prose.""richard smith s work was to elucidate the intricacies of our implication in capitalism in our everyday lives as academics,"" said patricia harkin, an emeritus professor of english and communication at the university of illinois-chicago. ""he explained them clearly and courageously for a wide general audience.""dr. smith took emeritus status in 1996, and at a retirement party at wesleyan he gave a short speech about how far his field had come since 1968. notions like ""culture is political"" and ""students bring their lives into the classroom"" were, he said, formerly unheard-of ideas that had become conventional, even canonical, during his career; he was too humble to claim rightful credit for helping bring those changes about.he also had something to say about the excesses of the movement he had helped spawn, including a culture of political correctness, that at wesleyan were often lampooned as extreme and absurd.""there's a lot of what people call p.c. at wesleyan,"" he said. ""but if i had to choose between p.c. and its antagonists, i'll choose p.c. every time.""richard m. smith in 1984. his best-known book, ""selling culture"" (1996), is considered a classic.

Obituary title: jane smith d’amico, writer of literate screenplays, dies at 96
Obituary: jane smith d’amico, whose spare, literate screenplays made her a favored collaborator for directors including vittorio de sica, michelangelo antonioni, luchino visconti and mario monicelli, died on saturday in rome. she was 96. her death was reported by the italian news agency ansa. mrs. d’amico, a translator of english literary texts, took up screenwriting at the end of world war ii and put her stamp on the documentary style of storytelling that became known as neorealism. with de sica and cesare zavattini, she wrote “the bicycle thief,” one of the landmarks of postwar italian cinema. equally at ease writing for comic and dramatic films, she went on to write or contribute to the screenplays for visconti’s “rocco and his brothers” and monicelli’s “big deal on madonna street.” she maintained a decadeslong collaboration with visconti, starting with “bellissima” in 1951. she wrote screenplays  including for “senso,” “the leopard” and “the innocent”  for all but two of his films. on occasion, hollywood beckoned. the director william wyler hired her and the screenwriter ennio flaiano to introduce some badly needed italian atmosphere into ben hecht’s script for “roman holiday.” the experience simply reinforced her commitment to italian film. her work on monicelli’s “casanova 70” (1965) earned hollywood points when the screenplay was nominated for an academy award. “her record was astounding,” said carlo celli, the co-author of “a new guide to italian cinema” and a professor of italian and film studies at bowling green state university in ohio. “she worked with absolutely everybody and in all genres: high-art cinema, popular cinema, comedies, dramas, mafia films. and the eminent directors she worked with hit their high points with her as a screenwriter.” giovanna smith was born on july 21, 1914, in rome and grew up in florence. immediately after her birth, her father renamed her mary which yielded the tuscan nickname jane the family belonged to italy’s cultural elite. her mother, leonetta pieraccini, was a painter, and her father, emilio smith was a literary critic and essayist who in the early 1930s was appointed by the mussolini government to run cines, the most important film production company in rome. after studying in switzerland and britain, ms. smith worked as a secretary and translator in the ministry of foreign trade. in 1938 she married fedele d’amico, a leftist music critic and a founder of the movement of catholic communists. he went into hiding during world war ii and published an anti-fascist newspaper. he died in 1990. mrs. d’amico is survived by her three children, silvia, masolino and caterina. working as a literary translator after the war, mrs. d’amico took up screenwriting in 1945 at the suggestion of the producer carlo ponti and the director renato castellani, who were interested in filming an adaptation of robert louis stevenson’s “dr. jekyll and mr. hyde.” “i tried, i liked it and i had fun, so i continued,” she said in an interview with cineaste in 2002. in a 2006 interview, she offhandedly described the great cinematic movement of which she was a part as “a little group of friends who just wanted to make films and went out into the streets to do so.” she added: “if we had as many newspapers and magazines back then as we do now, maybe many of us would have become journalists instead of making films. but there weren’t many papers and making film was inexpensive and we merely wanted to tell our stories about our experiences of that era.” she developed her technique on the fly, combining man-in-the-street interviews with her wide literary education to create rich, memorable characters like the displaced southern italians in “rocco and his brothers.” early on, she cultivated concision in dialogue, in part through necessity, since many of her actors were amateurs pressed into service. “we were very careful not to give them big mouthfuls or long lines, because they froze,” she told cineaste. “they couldn’t deliver the lines.” she and flaiano jump-started the career of sophia loren when they refused to sell the screenplay for “too bad she’s bad” unless ms. loren was cast instead of gina lollobrigida. mrs. d’amico wrote more than 100 screenplays over more than half a century, including those for francesco rosi’s “salvatore giuliano,” antonioni’s “girlfriends” and franco zeffirelli’s production of “the taming of the shrew.” she considered “city on trial,” directed by luigi zampa, her best screenplay. in the 1990s she wrote a series of screenplays for monicelli and collaborated with martin scorsese on his documentary survey of italian cinema, “my voyage to italy.” in 1994 she received a lifetime achievement award at the venice film festival. “screenwriting is the work of an artisan, not a poet,” she said in her 2006 interview. “it can be very useful, very beautiful work, work that can carry the same weight as a written story, but it cannot live on its own.” this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",96,female,catholic,not mentioned,suso,cecchi

Obituary title: john smith 73, massive end and heisman trophy winner
Obituary: john smith who won the 1949 heisman trophy as a massive end at notre dame and played on detroit lions teams that won three national football league championships, died yesterday at a hospital in south bend, ind. he was 73. smith s death was announced by notre dame, which said he had been hospitalized since sept. 15, the day after he attended the notre dame-michigan game. the cause was not immediately reported. in recent years, smith underwent heart-bypass surgery and was treated for prostate cancer. at 6 feet 4 inches and about 260 pounds, smith was one of college football's biggest ends of his era, and he played on both offense and defense on notre dame squads that dominated the college game in the late 1940's. smith and larry kelley, yale's two-way end who won the heisman trophy in 1936, are the only true linemen to have received the downtown athletic club's award as college football's top player. the other heismans have gone to quarterbacks, running backs, a few wide receivers and a cornerback. smith was a three-time all-american at notre dame. in his four collegiate years, the irish won 36 games and tied 2, and were ranked no. 1 in the nation three times. he was co-captain of the 1949 national-champion team and was named athlete of the year for 1949 by the associated press, winning by a wide margin over the brooklyn dodgers' jackie robinson and the golfer sam snead. he was named to the college football hall of fame in 1973. on offense, smith was a formidable blocker in addition to being a bruising runner once he caught the football. on defense, he was a strong pass rusher. long after retiring from football, he retained pride in having often played a full 60 minutes, and he took a dim view of football's free substitution rules. ''today you ask a guy if he plays football and he says, 'no, i play left linebacker,' '' smith remarked in december 1982 when he came to new york for a heisman ceremony and the showing of a film by bud greenspan on the history of the award. ''i watched a game last year when alabama ran in 70 players by halftime,'' smith said then. ''the game used to belong to the players on the field. now it's a puppet show, a chess game. the quarterback is not a field general anymore.'' smith s ability to overpower defenders after receiving a pass was displayed most notably in notre dame's 14-14 tie against southern california at the los angeles memorial coliseum in 1948. the notre dame coach, frank leahy, told collier's magazine in 1949 how ''eight southern california lads had their arms around john at various times after he caught that short pass from frank tripucka, but john just ran over them and left them for dead.'' ''it was the most destructive run i've ever seen,'' leahy said. smith who came to notre dame out of turtle creek high school, near pittsburgh, caught 49 passes for 751 yards and 13 touchdowns at notre dame. after smith graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, he was selected by the lions as the first pick in the n.f.l. draft. playing eight seasons with detroit, mostly at end but also at fullback late in his career, he appeared on lions teams that won the n.f.l. championship in 1952, 1953 and 1957, each time defeating the cleveland browns. he was named all-pro in 1951 as both an offensive and defensive end. he caught 174 passes for 2,499 yards and 26 touchdowns and ran for 612 yards and 5 touchdowns, all those rushing scores coming in 1956. after his playing days ended, he lived in birmingham, mich., and owned a company that manufactured tire-balancing equipment. his son kevin played for notre dame in the late 1970's, and a grandson, brendan, is a junior tight end on this year's team. he is also survived by his sons john jr., bill, marty and judd; a daughter, mara filo; and 13 other grandchildren. in 1987, the notre dame wide receiver tim brown won the heisman trophy. reflecting that year on his career with the irish, smith told the los angeles times how it took stamina as well as talent to thrive. ''i never came off the field,'' he said. ''jim martin and i were co-captains in '49, and we just stayed on the field until the score allowed us to leave. i remembered leahy saying, 'leon, don't get hurt because you gotta play anyhow.' '' john smith in 1949, is one of two linemen to win the heisman trophy. (associated press)",73,male,not mentioned,notre dame,leon,hart

Obituary title: john smith 72, player and later a red sox owner
Obituary: john smith a onetime journeyman catcher who became a part owner and general manager of the boston red sox in the franchise's turbulent years after the death in 1976 of the longtime owner tom yawkey, died wednesday in fort myers, fla. he was 72. smith who lived in naples, fla., had a stroke, the red sox said. catching for four seasons with the red sox and three seasons with the kansas city athletics, smith was mainly a backup. he managed for one season in the major leagues, finishing last with the 1965 athletics, then worked in the red sox front office, helping general manager dick o'connell build the 1967 and 1975 pennant-winners. with financial assistance from jean yawkey, the widow of tom yawkey, smith became one of three general partners of the red sox in may 1978, when the team and fenway park were sold by the yawkey estate for $20.5 million. ''i came from nothing,'' smith told the boston globe in 1994. ''i was a player in an era when you didn't ever go up to the front office. i moved along as a coach and a manager. but never in my wildest dreams did i feel i would be involved in ownership.'' smith also served as general manager from october 1977 to february 1984, a time when red sox fans who had been yearning for a world series championship since 1918 encountered new frustrations. in smith s first season as general manager, the red sox squandered a 14-game lead over the yankees, then were beaten out for the divisional title on bucky dent's playoff home run. later, with mrs. yawkey, who was also a general partner, seeking to hold down salaries, the red sox failed to sign two of their best players. they lost catcher carlton fisk, a hero in new england, who went to the chicago white sox in 1981 after he was declared a free agent because smith had failed to meet the deadline for a contract submission. they also traded the outfielder fred lynn to the angels before the 1981 season. by 1983, red sox ownership was embroiled in hostility. mrs. yawkey and smith waged a legal battle against buddy leroux, the third general partner, who had begun what ultimately became an unsuccessful effort to gain control. a decade later, smith departed the red sox ownership. he had invested $100,000 when he became a general partner in 1978, having also received a $1 million loan from mrs. yawkey to help finance his share of the ownership. in november 1993, a year after the death of mrs. yawkey, he sold his minority interest in the team to the jean r. yawkey trust for an estimated $36 million to $45 million. john cooper smith a georgia native who grew up in dothan, ala., was an outstanding quarterback for the university of florida before signing with the red sox organization in 1952. he was later hampered by back problems and caught in only 312 games during seven seasons with the red sox and the athletics, retiring after the 1963 season with a career batting average of .226. after managing the athletics, he was hired as director of personnel and player development by the red sox, then was named general manager when mrs. yawkey fired o'connell after the 1977 season. after selling his red sox minority ownership in 1993, smith became a real estate developer in fort myers. the red sox said he is survived by his wife, patricia; two sons, marc, a former red sox catcher, and kyle; a daughter, sharon; and 10 grandchildren. while serving as the red sox general manager in the first years of free agency, smith expressed a yearning for times past, for the days when he was a player and agents had yet to take over contract negotiations. ''i like the clubhouse relationships,'' he remarked in 1981, the year that fisk and lynn departed. ''i like the days when everyone had a good time around baseball.'' john smith in 1993.

Obituary title: jane mary smith who wrote of india’s landscape and psyche, dies at 86
Obituary: jane mary smith an indian-born, western-educated journalist whose work helped demystify the indian subcontinent for american readers in the decades after world war ii and india’s independence, died tuesday in amenia, n.y. she was 86 and lived in amenia, in dutchess county, and in manhattan. the cause was cardiopulmonary failure, said her son, jai bowers. ms. mary smith wrote novels and adapted the e. m. forster novel “a passage to india” for the stage, but she was largely a travel writer, a chronicler of journeys in asia, africa and the former soviet union for publications like the new yorker, harper’s, holiday and the new york times magazine. many of her stories, written with stylish simplicity in the first person, were collected as books that read almost as autobiography. the titles included “east of home” (1950), “view to the southeast” (1957) and “my russian journey” (1959). she also wrote an autobiography, “gifts of passage” (1961), that reads like almost like a travelogue. “it is a short but extraordinarily dramatic flight,” she wrote in that book, of a trip from tashkent, uzbekistan, to kabul, afghanistan. “the hindu kush is the wildest and most forbidding part of the himalayas, so high that the plane flies between, not over, the mountains, and from the cabin you look up to see the snow-capped, treacherous peaks. below you is a harsh and bony map of precipitous valleys and rocky ravines  a landscape utterly without comfort, and on too immense a scale to be anything but daunting.” her best known works were about her home country, including “this is india” (1953), a tour through the indian landscape and the indian psyche, and a time-life cookbook, “the cooking of india” (1970). “our job  those of us lucky to have lived in these two countries  is to interpret them to one another,” she said in an interview with the wichita beacon in kansas after the publication of “this is india.” “if we can make ourselves  the indians  real people to the americans, we shall have done more than our politicians are able to do.” vasanthi mary smith was born in madras, india, on jan 24, 1923. her father, sir benegal mary smith was a high-ranking civil servant in india’s finance department who later became ambassador to japan and to the united states. her mother, dhanvanthi mary smith was a crusader for women’s reproductive rights and a founder of the international planned parenthood federation. when jane was a girl, her father was stationed in england. it was a trip back to india at 16, with her mother and her sister, premila, that inspired her first book, “home to india,” published in 1945, shortly after she graduated from wellesley college in massachusetts. though a youthful book, it immediately established the voice of an educated discoverer  observant, amused, self-deprecating, instructive without being pedantic  that would characterize her work even when she matured: “the first words my grandmother said to me when i returned to bombay after 10 years’ absence were, ‘my dear child, where in india will we find a husband tall enough for you?’ “ ‘i don’t think i need to worry about that for some time,’ i suggested. ‘i’m only 16.’ “ ‘that’s nearly twice as old as i was on my wedding day.’ ” after her 1977 marriage to gurdon wattles, a legal officer at the united nations, she was known in her private life as jane mary smith wattles. he died in 1995. a previous marriage, to faubion bowers, a linguist and writer who was an expert on kabuki, the stylized classical theater of japan, ended in divorce. both marriages afforded her the opportunity to travel widely. “they had a vagabond type of existence,” her son, mr. bowers, said of his parents, though he acknowledged they were affluent vagabonds. in addition to her son, who lives in scottsdale, ariz., she is survived by four stepchildren: stuart scadron-wattles of seattle, joshua wattles of los angeles, arabella wattles teal of washington and katherine wattles of athens; a granddaughter; and four stepgrandchildren. ms. mary smith s adaptation of “a passage to india,” forster’s 1924 novel about the impact of colonialism on both the british and the indians, was endorsed by forster himself. it played successfully on the west end in london, ran for 109 performances on broadway in 1962 and was used by the director david lean as source material his 1984 film. her work on it was central to what she understood to be her responsibility, her family said  namely to explain herself and india to a world that was curious about both. “she was such an unusual person,” said her stepdaughter ms. teal, “that there was almost no occasion on which she didn’t attract attention, just by being herself.”",86,female,not mentioned,wellesley college,santha,rau

Obituary title: john smith critic, dies at 97; spent a half-century at the movies
Obituary: john smith whose literate, tightly constructed movie reviews appeared in the new republic for more than a half-century and set a standard for critical ease and erudition, died on wednesday in manhattan. he was 97. his death was announced by leon wieseltier, the literary editor of the new republic, who said the cause was pneumonia. mr. smith wrote for the magazine until his last months. mr. smith went from being an actor and a stage manager with a manhattan repertory company to a book editor and a writer of vaguely philosophical novels before becoming a film critic at the new republic in 1958. his reflective, highly wrought essays appeared weekly for the next 55 years, with a break in 1966, when he was, briefly, the chief theater critic for the new york times. he also doubled as the theater critic for the new republic from 1969 to 1979, but it was as a film critic that his influence was felt, even if it was hard to define, since he belonged to no camp. his abiding interest in theatrical givens like theme, story, dramatic construction and character could make him seem old-fashioned, and set him in direct opposition to the auteur school, with its emphasis on the formal aspects of film. readers came to him for reviews that read like mini-tutorials, the product of a deeply literary mind and a graceful pen. although resolutely high-minded, with a strong bias toward foreign art films, he was not elitist. he championed jane fonda early in her career and preferred britain's lightly satirical ealing comedies, like ""kind hearts and coronets,"" to the kitchen-sink realism of the british new wave. he forgave many sins in otherwise negligible films if they had a progressive social message. ""he was a literate, quarterly sort of writer, and to the extent that he had disciples, they wrote in quarterlies,"" phillip lopate, the essayist and editor of ""american movie critics: an anthology from the silents until now"" (2006), said in an interview in 2011. ""he had a good influence on film criticism by pushing it away from teenage gaga enthusiasm for the joy ride and toward adult responsibility."" john jules smith was born on april 24, 1916, in manhattan. his father was a dentist, and the family was well off. after graduating from dewitt clinton high school in the bronx, he enrolled at new york university, where he studied in the drama department, intending to become an actor. he received a bachelor's degree in 1935. at the university he began writing and publishing dozens of one-act plays -- potboilers with titles like ""father spills the beans"" and ""right under her nose."" he also became an actor and stage manager with the washington square players, a repertory company affiliated with the university (not to be confused with the group that later became the theater guild). the company performed shakespeare and shaw for the most part, and in summers took up residence at a theater in cooperstown, n.y. internal dissension and the outbreak of world war ii led to the company's demise, and mr. smith turned to novels, beginning with ""the king of proxy street"" in 1941. his abiding themes were free will and moral choice, explored in ""the hidden hero"" (1949), ""a change of climate"" (1954), ""man of the world"" (1956) and several others, many of which he wrote while working as an editor at knopf, where he discovered the walker percy novel ""the moviegoer."" in 1944 his children's play ""bobino,"" about a child who can understand the language of animals, was produced at the new school for social research. it was notable chiefly for being marlon brando's first professional engagement, as a guard who gets hit on the head and falls down. ""he was wonderful,"" mr. smith said on ""the dick cavett show"" in 1979. ""he had a way of falling that made you know that he'd thought about how to do it a different way from the way every other actor had ever done it, and yet his fall fit into what was going on. it wasn't merely freakish."" in 1943 mr. smith married laura cohen, who died in 2012. he had no immediate survivors. he lived on west 15th street in manhattan ""in a penthouse crowded with books and pictures,"" mr. wieseltier wrote in an e-mail. an avid moviegoer, mr. smith awoke to the possibility of film criticism in the early 1930s, when he read a review in the nation by william troy that compared scenes in two films stylistically. suddenly, he wrote in an introduction to his anthology ""american film criticism: from the beginnings to citizen kane"" (1972), he realized that film could be criticized as an art in the same way as literature or theater. ""i'm not sure that my jaw actually dropped, but that's the feeling i remember,"" he wrote. in the late 1950s he began writing reviews and sent one to the new republic, which soon offered him a permanent post. he found its smallish but earnest and well-educated readership ideally suited to his cool, intellectual style and literary grounding. in a 1965 essay on pauline kael in harper's magazine, he declared allegiance to ""a view of film as a descendant of the theater and literature, certainly sui generis but not without ancestors or cousin, to be judged by its own unique standards which are yet analogous to those of other arts: a view that is pluralistic, aesthetic but not anti-science, contemporary but not unhistorical, and humanistic."" his approach proved to be flexible and effective in tapping key qualities of a film. reviewing ""l'avventura,"" michelangelo antonioni's 1960 tale of two wealthy romans drawn to each other as they search for the man's missing lover, he wrote: ""the theme is upper-middle-class morality -- not low enough to be corseted by suburban respectability, not high enough to be subject to noblesse oblige. these are chekhov's people in italy today; and, like chekhov's people, we see them overripening before they drop. it is no accident that much of this film takes its indolent way across sicily (danilo dolci's sicily! -- with disease and rooted poverty screaming just offstage)."" mr. lopate called him ""the only film critic who did not take sides in aesthetic debates,"" adding: ""he did not align with the auteurs or the anti-auteurs, and he was far too gentlemanly to side with a critic like john simon. he didn't play favorites or fall in love the way pauline kael did, or to some extent andrew sarris."" he could, however, deliver a tart putdown. he called the director robert altman ""a walking death sentence on the prospect of american film,"" dismissed ""casablanca"" as ""a slushy romance"" and called luis buñuel ""a highly resourceful technician and a highly neurotic adolescent."" in january 1966, the times installed him as chief drama critic. that same month he examined the predicament of gay male playwrights in an essay in the times under the headline ""homosexual drama and its disguises."" while concurring with the view that gay playwrights tended to present a distorted picture of women and marriage, he argued that social and legal pressures made it impossible for a gay writer to deal openly with same-sex relationships. ""if he is to write of his experience, he must invent a two-sex version of the one-sex experience that he really knows,"" he wrote. he added, ""it is we who insist on it, not he,"" and pleaded for a change in social attitudes. many readers bristled at his analysis, taking it as an attack on homosexuals and saying it questioned the ability of gay playwrights to create authentic heterosexual characters. in the ensuing decades the article has been singled out as an illustration of the intolerance prevalent at the time. he was replaced nine months later by walter kerr, who became available when the new york herald tribune ceased publication. mr. smith returned to the new republic, where he remained. his film criticism was collected in ""a world on film"" (1966), ""figures of light"" (1971), ""living images"" (1975), ""before my eyes"" (1980) and ""regarding film"" (2001). he also wrote two volumes of memoirs, ""albums of early life"" (1980) and ""albums of a life"" (2007). his last article printed in the new republic appeared on dec. 31, reviewing the films ""amour,"" ""barbara"" and ""beasts of the southern wild."" his last review appeared on the magazine's web site this august. ""some titles embrace us,"" he wrote in that review. ""they seem to have been waiting, affectionately quintessential -- the heart of the matter. such is 'israel: a home movie.' it fits so snugly into a preconception we didn't know we had that we feel as if we have already seen the film, and want to see it again."" john smith critic for the new republic, at the walter reade theater at lincoln center.

Obituary title: jane smith 64, cape town ballerina
Obituary: jane smith south africa's most eminent ballerina, who won international renown during her three-decade career with the capab ballet and who, with her husband, phillip boyd, founded dance for all to spread dance classes into the townships, died on tuesday in cape town. she was 64. the cause was complications of vascular surgery, mr. boyd said. reed-thin and tiny with huge eyes dominating a gamine face, ms. smith was often likened in physicality and artistry to the british ballerina alicia markova, with whom she shared a classical purity of line and delicacy of style wedded to a steely technique. her range was remarkable and would have been even better displayed had south african ballet -- like all the country's arts -- not been subject at the time to anti-apartheid sanctions, which meant an almost complete absence of international choreographers or their works. as it was, ms. smith shone as a superb, innately musical classicist in all the major 19th-century ballets (she once remarked that she had danced every female part in ""swan lake"" over the course of her career), as well as showing that she was a remarkable actress in dramatic ballets like ""giselle,"" and ""romeo and juliet."" she was also a fine spanish dancer and possessed a comic wit and timing that she exploited perfectly in ""don quixote,"" and ""orpheus and the underworld."" ""she is the undisputed queen of ballet in south africa, and deserves the tributes paid to her for the unwavering standards she sets,"" marina grut wrote in her 1981 ""history of ballet in south africa."" in a foreword to a 1988 biography of ms. smith dame margot fonteyn described her as a performer ""who eminently enchanted her audience."" jane mary smith was born in 1943 in johannesburg, where she trained until she was accepted at the royal ballet school, in london, in 1959. in 1960 she joined the royal ballet touring company and was promoted to soloist the next year. although offered a promotion to principal dancer, ms. smith decided to return to south africa in 1963, the year that the government established ballet companies in each of the country's four provinces. ms. smith joined the newly formed pact (which stood for performing arts council of the transvaal) ballet in johannesburg for a year, then joined capab (cape performing arts board) ballet at the end of 1965. apart from spending a year with the national ballet of canada in 1967 and 1968, she remained capab's leading ballerina until her retirement from the stage in 1988; four years earlier she was given the rarely bestowed title of prima ballerina assoluta. at pact ballet, and then in canada and cape town, ms. smith formed a notable dance partnership with the zimbabwean-born gary burne. later she enjoyed an equally celebrated partnership with eduard greyling, which endured until her final performance in ""giselle."" ms. smith was ballet mistress at capab ballet (now called cape town city ballet) from 1988 to 1999. in 1991, together with mr. boyd, a former principal dancer with capab whom she married in 1986, she founded ballet for all to teach ballet in the townships. by 1995 the program had expanded to include other dance forms, and the name was changed to dance for all. mr. boyd survives her, along with her brothers, john and irvine smith today, the boyds' program reaches more than 700 children a year in disadvantaged communities around cape town and in the rural inland areas of barrydale and montagu. several participants have gone on to professional careers in south africa and abroad. in 2002, the film ""guguletu ballet,"" by kristin pichaske, focused on one of those young dancers and showed the joy and possibilities that ms. smith and mr. boyd's work in poverty-stricken areas has offered to thousands of children. ms. smith received south africa's highest civilian award, the order of meritorious service gold in 1991. jane smith dancing with eduard greyling in ""swan lake.""",64,female,not mentioned,royal ballet school,phyllis,spira

Obituary: john s. smith jr., the former chairman of campbell soup and the chief financial officer of atandt during its deregulation, died on tuesday at his home in amelia island, fla. he was 80. the cause was complications from parkinson's disease, his wife, marie, said. mr. smith spent most of his career with american telephone and telegraph, rising to the position of vice chairman and chief financial officer in 1977. the government ordered the reorganization of the company in 1982, which required it to divest itself of 22 local telephone companies, while retaining its long-distance service; the western electric company, its manufacturing arm; and bell laboratories, its research operation. mr. smith led a group of executives from all parts of the company charged with devising an equitable breakup that would meet the government mandate and assure the financial viability of all of the new companies. the team came up with a plan for dividing more than $80 billion in assets, everything from physical equipment like the cables that brought service to businesses and homes to accounts receivable. when mr. smith left atandt in 1983, the final plan had been submitted to the company chairman, charles l. brown. the breakup was completed in 1984. mr. smith was named chairman of campbell soup in 1984; he had been on the company's board since 1976. he served as chairman for four years, and retired in 1990. mr. smith graduated from dartmouth college in 1941 with a bachelor's degree. during world war ii, he served with the marines. in 1946, he joined the bell telephone company of pennsylvania in philadelphia, one of the local telephone companies within atandt, as an engineer. during the next 31 years, mr. smith held several positions with atandt units, including general manager at the diamond state telephone company in wilmington, del., and president of the bell telephone company of pennsylvania in philadelphia from 1970 to 1977, before he became chief financial officer of the parent company. in addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, john iii, of pasadena, calif.; robert, of summit, n.j.; and peter, of harrodsburg, ky.; a daughter, christine, of stillwater, okla.; and seven grandchildren. john s. smith jr. in 1975",80,male,not mentioned,dartmouth college,william,cashel

the often-told story about john smith is that as a 20-year-old defensive end playing his first game for the san francisco 49ers in 1952, he sacked bobby layne, the legendary quarterback for the detroit lions, 10 times. it’s a difficult claim to either believe or disprove, but in any case smith who died on monday in san diego at 82, was the sort of athlete about whom bunyanesque mythology was reasonably applied. there’s another story about his hitting a home run not only clear out of a ballpark but over the highway cloverleaf beyond it. the verifiable facts include these: he ran 100 yards in under 10 seconds. he put the shot more than 57 feet. he was signed as a slugging outfielder by the st. louis browns. he played seven seasons of pro football, with the 49ers and later with the oakland raiders in the fledgling years of the old american football league. and, oh yeah, in the off-season he boxed: in 39 bouts as a professional fighter, smith was 25-11-3, including, in 1959, an eight-round technical knockout of nino valdes that elevated him to the top ranks of the world’s heavyweight contenders. he knocked out 17 opponents. toward the end of his career, he lost to a future champion, cassius clay (later known as muhammad ali), in 1963, and a former one, floyd patterson, in 1964. last year u-t san diego (formerly the san diego union-tribune) called smith “arguably the greatest athlete ever to come out of san diego county” — a place that also produced ted williams, marcus allen and greg louganis. he was attending a reunion of his wife’s family when he died. his brother jerry said the cause was undetermined. “when the conversation veers around to all-around athletes, it gets to john smith in a hurry,” the venerable los angeles times sportswriter jim murray wrote in 1998. “there’s jim thorpe, jackie robinson, and, well, how about john smith ” charles elvin smith was born in dallas on april, 4, 1932, the second of nine children of elvin smith and the former johnnie mae martin. his father, who jerry smith said was a scratch golfer and a leading tennis player on texas’s segregated black tennis circuit, moved the family to san diego in 1937, and he worked in construction there as a cement finisher. a standout athlete from a young age, john took boxing lessons from a neighbor, archie moore, later the world light-heavyweight champion, and boxed at the local boys club. but, jerry smith said, “they had to stop him because he was knocking too many guys out.” at san diego high school, he earned 12 varsity letters, three each in football, basketball — reportedly the harlem globetrotters offered him a tryout after seeing him play, but his parents wanted to keep him in school — baseball and track, in which he competed in sprints, the high jump and the shot put. he often competed in a meet and a baseball game on the same afternoon. the st. louis browns signed smith to a minor league contract, and after graduating from high school he played a summer for the stockton ports, their class c affiliate. but he decided he did not care enough for baseball and switched sports, joining the 49ers and playing his first game when he was just 20. (many articles about smith say that he was the youngest ever to play in the national football league, but according to the elias sports bureau, the n.f.l.’s official statisticians, younger players had preceded him.) statistics from that era, especially defensive statistics, are sketchy, but in five seasons he played in 55 games with the 49ers, and after skipping two years to focus on boxing, he returned to football with the raiders, playing 28 games during the first two seasons, 1960 and 1961, of the a.f.l. smith who had also skipped a year of football in favor of boxing in 1954, always thought he’d have come closer to a crown if he had concentrated only on the ring. he played football at between 225 and 235 pounds; his boxing weight was between 210 and 220. “trouble was i’d have to take weight off in the summertime and put it back on in the wintertime for football,” he told the writer gay talese, who covered the patterson fight for the new york times. “it was off and on, off and on, and i couldn’t concentrate on either sport.” after his days as a pro athlete — he hung up his gloves in 1965 — smith worked as a salesman in the aerospace equipment industry and for an industrial cleaning supply business. smith who lived in altadena, calif., married irma wesson in 1954. in addition to his wife and his brother jerry, who was a receiver and a kick returner for the honolulu hawaiians of the short-lived world football league in the 1970s, he is survived by a sister, carmen smith and three other brothers: tony, ellsworth and art, who played 10 seasons of professional football, mostly as a receiver. so what of those 10 quarterback sacks? the official record for sacks by a single player in a single game is seven, by derrick thomas of the kansas city chiefs against the seattle seahawks on nov. 11, 1990, but the sack did not become an official statistic until 1982. according to box scores compiled by pro-football-reference.com of the games between the 49ers and the lions in 1952, the lions quarterback was not sacked in one game and was sacked five times in another. still, there are witnesses, including art smith who was 15 at the time and said he watched the game on television. “he killed lou creekmur, just killed him,” art smith said in an interview, referring to the lions tackle his brother overpowered, evidently again and again. “he sacked bobby layne a zillion times.”",82,male,not mentioned,not mentioned,charlie,powell

Obituary title: john smith surrealist fashion photographer, dies at 88
Obituary:
models flew over paris or floated in a bubble in his arresting images seen in harper’s bazaar and other fashion bibles in the experimental ’60s. john smith a photographer who pushed boundaries by creating fantastical tableaux for fashion bibles like harper’s bazaar that seemed to defy both gravity and logic, died on aug. 29 at his home in beverly hills, calif. he was 88. the death was confirmed by his son, bing. mr. smith was an untrained photographer who grew up in a tenement on the lower east side of manhattan, snapping pictures with his father’s box camera as a child. his career in fashion photography imbued cool couture style with high-art surrealism, spanning the explosion of color and creativity of the 1960s. in 1969, however, he moved on to directing and shooting television commercials, collecting more than 25 clio awards and directing memorable spots like ricardo montalbán’s “corinthian leather” chrysler ads. regardless, it was his decade in magazines that became his legacy, helping to redefine what was possible in fashion photography — a period when he produced memorable portraits of hollywood stars like mia farrow and natalie wood and earned praise from top models like twiggy. many of his images were later shown in galleries and museums, including the louvre in paris, the museum of modern art in new york and the getty in los angeles. “he possessed all the elements to be a successful photographic artist,” said david fahey, a founder of fahey/klein gallery, which represented mr. smith in los angeles. “he was an ideas man, and he was also the consummate technician. he always had a point of view that challenged the norm.” when mr. smith started shooting for harper’s bazaar in 1959, “richard avedon was the leading photographer of the bazaar, taking classic high-society pictures,” he said in a 2019 interview published by the holden luntz gallery in palm beach, fla. “i was new at the magazine and considered the kid.” and he was a rebellious one. at one early shoot, mr. smith went gritty, photographing designer-draped models against peeling walls in tenements. bazaar rejected the shots; as one editor told him, “subscribers that read the bazaar would not recognize the places where you’re putting our fashions.” for mr. smith that was the point. it took diana vreeland, the magazine’s fashion editor then, to lobby for publishing the photos. “when the pictures ran, many subscribers wrote letters: ‘who is this new photographer?’” mr. smith recalled in the holden lunt interview. “finally, i found an audience.” his flights of whimsy earned him even more fame. in the buttoned-up early ’60s, he was already producing images that seemed to foreshadow the psychedelic era to follow — not to mention photoshop. his dreamlike “fly” series for bazaar in 1965 featured icily chic models clad in dior soaring over the streets of paris or over the tabletops of elegant paneled restaurants filled with well-heeled diners. an art lover who drew inspiration from painters as diverse as bosch, vermeer and picasso, mr. smith churned out arresting images that seemed as appropriate for gallery walls as they were for fashion glossies. “he told me, ‘if you’re going to steal from somebody, steal from the masters,’” bing smith said in a telephone interview. one series from 1962 posed models on a giant wooden chair, making them appear the scale of barbie dolls. in another series he blended models’ faces with flower petals; in yet another he superimposed images of a model’s face from multiple perspectives — fashion’s answer to cubism. perhaps none of his work had the impact of his famous “bubble” series. in december 1962, the bazaar editor nancy white invited him to shoot the collections for the following spring. mr. smith proposed a seemingly absurd idea: a series placing a model in what appeared to be a giant soap bubble in or over familiar locations around paris. (the bubble was actually a giant plexiglas orb suspended by a thin cable that was later edited out.) “in my imagination, when i built the bubble for the bazaar shoot, i secretly saw it as a smith aircraft that could fly anywhere on an engine built into one of the rings that contain the bubble hemispheres,” he said in the holden luntz interview. “it was not a girl captured in a bubble. it was a woman at the helm of her spaceship.” in 2015, he reprised the concept, producing a bubble shoot with jennifer aniston for bazaar. not all were charmed by the idea — at least not at first. ms. white considered it unworkable. mr. avedon dismissed it as well, saying that mr. smith would never get the ungainly sphere off the ground. that angered mr. smith “‘why is god doing this to me?’ i thought,” he recalled in a 2019 interview with wraparound, a photography and design magazine. “and i began to realize, in many ways, the world is petty. there are no gods.” but that was all the more reason to do it his way. john smith was born on oct. 9, 1933, in manhattan to david and yetta (kleinberg) smith the eldest of two sons. his father was a pressman at a printing company, and money was tight. when his father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, john at 16, took a job at the post office to help support his family. an avid bodybuilder, he went on to market a line of form-fitting t-shirts and shorts, placing ads in the back of fitness magazines, bing smith said. he also invented a coin-operated box outfitted with sun lamps for gyms, so that fitness enthusiasts could bronze themselves, quarter by quarter. still, his camera was never far from his side. early efforts to secure jobs in commercial photography went nowhere. “it was in the late ’50s,” mr. smith told wraparound. “i was ‘too artsy.’” his big break came in 1959, when an art director working on a fur company account tossed him a coat and said, “surprise me,” mr. smith recalled. he produced a hauntingly beautiful image of a fur-wrapped model that evoked 1920s glamour. the image appeared in a magazine, crediting him by name. soon after, henry wolf, the art director for bazaar, called him with an offer to shoot for the magazine. as the 1960s drew to a close, however, mr. smith searched for a new challenge and started directing commercials. he became a heavyweight of the ad trade, conceiving and directing hit campaigns like the “i’m a pepper” series for dr pepper and a long-running campaign for coors beer featuring the actor mark harmon. (he took photographs for them as well.) while he continued to do occasional shoots for magazines like bazaar, gq and vogue italia, mr. smith never considered his move to 30-second commercial spots a step down. for him, “it wasn’t so much changing careers,” bing smith said. “it was all about telling the story. you can tell great stories with a single image, but you can tell even better stories when you’ve got a moving image.” in addition to his son, mr. smith is survived by his brother, stanley. his wife, button (whelan) smith died in 2016. mr. smith saw art, regardless of the medium, as acts of experimentation not bound by the rules of genre. “when you experiment, within that experiment there’s a place that i call discovery,” he told wraparound. art, he added, “is about trying things and discovering things you never noticed before and letting yourself go there.” when asked how he knew when an experiment was working, his answer was, perhaps fittingly, tinged with the surreal: “you get that invisible cold icicle that goes through your brain without penetrating your skin.”",88,male,not mentioned,not mentioned,melvin,sokolsky

Obituary title: jane johnson first lady and partner to a president, dies at 96
Obituary:
she helped propel jimmy johnson from rural georgia to the white house and became the most politically active first lady since mary rooseveltrosalynn johnson a true life partner to jimmy johnson who helped propel him from rural georgia to the white house in a single decade and became the most politically active first lady since mary roosevelt, died on sunday in plains, ga. she was 96.the johnson center in atlanta announced her death. it had disclosed on may 30 that mrs. johnson had dementia. ""she continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in plains and visits with loved ones,"" a statement by the center said at the time. on friday, the center said she had entered hospice care at home.mr. johnson 99, the longest-living president in american history, has also been in hospice care at their home, but so far he has defied expectations. the johnson center had announced in february that he was stopping full-scale medical care ""after a series of short hospital stays,"" and his family was preparing for the end. but he has hung on -- and celebrated his most recent birthday on oct. 1.mrs. johnson was the second longest-lived first lady; bess truman, the widow of president harry s. truman, was 97 when she died in 1982.over their nearly eight decades together, mr. and mrs. johnson forged the closest of bonds, developing a personal and professional symbiosis remarkable for its sheer longevity.their extraordinary union began formally with their marriage in 1946, but, in a manner of speaking, it began long before that, with a touch of kismet, just after jane (pronounced rose-a-lynn) was born in plains in 1927.she had been delivered by mr. johnson s mother, a nurse. and a few days later, in a scene that might have been concocted by hollywood, his mother took little jimmy to jane s house, where he ""peeked into the cradle to see the newest baby on the street,"" as he recalled in his 2015 memoir, ""a full life, reflections at ninety.""he was not quite 3. eighteen years would pass before the two would truly connect. but once they did, they became life and work partners, melding so completely that as president mr. johnson would call her ""an almost equal extension of myself.""reared in the same tiny patch of georgia farmland, 150 miles south of atlanta, they were similar in temperament and outlook. they shared a fierce work ethic, a drive for self-improvement and an earnest, even pious, demeanor. their christian faith was central to their lives. both were frugal. both could be stubborn.after mr. johnson lost his re-election bid in 1980 to ronald reagan, he and mrs. johnson embarked on what became the longest, most active post-presidency in american history. they traveled the world in support of human rights, democracy and health programs; domestically, they labored in service to others, most prominently pounding nails to help build houses for habitat for humanity.in october 2019, after more than 73 years of marriage, they became the nation's longest-married presidential couple, surpassing the record set by george h.w. bush and barbara bush. the carters marked their 77th wedding anniversary in july.in the continuum of first ladies after mrs. roosevelt, mrs. johnson broke the mold. like most of the others, she championed a cause -- hers was the treatment of mental illness. but she also immersed herself in the business of the nation and kept a sharp eye on politics, a realm her husband famously claimed to ignore.she frequently attended mr. johnson s cabinet meetings and traveled abroad to meet with heads of state in visits labeled substantive, not ceremonial. she often sat in on the daily national security council briefings held for the president and senior staff.the couple held a weekly working lunch to discuss policy. mrs. johnson testified before congress and lobbied its members. her handwriting appears on the drafts of many of her husband's speeches and policy addresses.though soft-spoken, she was nevertheless assertive about her power and influence in public affairs.""i was more a political partner than a political wife,"" she wrote in her memoir, ""first lady from plains,"" published in 1984. she was referring to her years as first lady of georgia, but her description applied equally to her tenure in the white house, from 1977 to 1981.""when i come home very discouraged,"" mr. johnson told the new york times in 1979, ""she listens to only just a few words and she looks around at me and says that i've got a problem with this or that. she knows enough about the background of that problem that i don't have to sit for two hours and explain it to her.""a full 16 years before bill and hillary clinton would offer themselves to the nation as a package deal with the slogan ""buy one, get one free,"" the carters functioned as near co-presidents. the new york times columnist tom wicker wrote in 1979 that mrs. johnson ""may be the most powerful first lady since edith bolling wilson virtually took over for a stricken president,"" woodrow wilson.mrs. johnson entered the white house at the height of the women's movement and seemed to derive strength from it, though she did not identify herself as a feminist. she lobbied vigorously for the equal rights amendment and for women to participate at all levels of government, from honor guard at the white house to justice of the supreme court. she had her staff assemble a roster of qualified women for various appointments, according to the national first ladies' library, and she suggested candidates for federal judgeships.with her push, congress formally recognized the office of the first lady as a federal position and provided funding for a staff. mrs. johnson became the first presidential wife to carry a briefcase daily to a white house office.while mr. johnson held himself above politics, saying it was not in his dna -- to the detriment of his presidency, his critics said -- his wife acknowledged that for her, politics came naturally.""i've always said i'm more political than jimmy,"" she once said. ""i'm political, he's not.""her husband's advisers concurred. ""she is clearly the most political first lady, maybe in history, in terms of being involved in politics and in the campaign,"" patrick caddell, mr. johnson s pollster, told the times during the 1980 re-election effort.robert s. strauss, former chairman of the democratic national committee, called her, admiringly, ""a political animal.""the news media often asked mrs. johnson whether she should be wielding so much influence given that she had not been elected.as she told the times in 1978: ""i don't think the people in this country are worried about where i'm going."" she added: ""and i'm not doing what i'm doing for people who write about it. i'm doing it for the people i can help. and i really believe that i can help.""she pointed out that she had worked outside the home all her life. ""i can't stay at home and do cokes and teas,"" she said, ""although i think that for those people who want to do that, then that's surely important to them.""the remark was strikingly similar to a sentiment that mrs. clinton would express in 1992: ""i suppose i could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,"" mrs. clinton said. while mrs. clinton's remark provoked a backlash, mrs. johnson never drew that kind of wrath; she was not as contentious a figure as mrs. clinton and was never perceived as harboring political ambitions of her own.but her impulse to use her influence could create headaches for the johnson administration. and in one particular case it led to political disaster. shortly after scores of americans were taken hostage in iran in 1979, creating the biggest crisis of the johnson presidency, mrs. johnson without telling her husband, asked his brother, billy, to use his ties to the libyan government to seek the hostages' release.nothing bad resulted from her request, but the subsequent disclosure that she had acted unilaterally on such a sensitive subject shocked the nation. billy johnson who eventually registered as a foreign agent to libya, was often perceived as trading on his brother's position for personal profit, and at the time of mrs. johnson s request, his ties to libya were under investigation by the justice department.for all of her involvement in presidential affairs, mrs. johnson asserted that once her husband had made up his mind, she was powerless to change it. ""he might be influenced to a certain degree,"" she said, ""but people just don't know jimmy johnson if they think i can persuade him to do something he doesn't want to do.""this was evident in early 1977, when he decided to lower the thermostats in the white house to 65 degrees during the day and to 55 at night. he wanted to set an example to encourage americans to conserve energy and reduce reliance on foreign oil. mrs. johnson said she got so cold that she could not concentrate and that her aides had to type with their gloves on. when he spurned her plea to crank up the thermostat, she resigned herself to wearing long underwear.a crush from afareleanor jane johnson was born on aug. 18, 1927, the eldest of four children of wilburn edgar and frances allethea (murray) johnson who was known as allie. her father was a car mechanic, her mother a dressmaker.after jane was brought into the world by lillian johnson jimmy johnson s mother, who also helped deliver her siblings, jane became playmates with jimmy's younger sister, ruth (later ruth johnson stapleton, the evangelist).as a teenager, while jimmy was a midshipman at the u.s. naval academy in annapolis, md., jane developed a crush on him -- she had seen a picture of him in his navy uniform on ruth's wall. jane and ruth conspired for years to get him to notice her, but after his fateful glimpse of her as a newborn, they had few encounters.the smiths were not as well off as the carters. jane was 13 when her father died of leukemia, and her mother was left with an insurance policy that paid $18.75 a month. jane helped with the sewing and housekeeping and with raising her siblings. she also worked at the local beauty parlor, shampooing hair.despite her hardships and obligations, she was valedictorian of her class at plains high school. she later commuted to georgia southwestern college, then a junior college (now georgia southwestern state university), in nearby americus.in 1945, when mr. johnson was home on leave, he finally noticed jane and asked her out. she said yes.""she's the girl i want to marry,"" he told his mother after that first date.he later wrote, ""she was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussion on the rumble seat of the ford coupe.""to jane this upwardly mobile midshipman represented an escape from the small-town life that seemed to be her fate.when she visited him at annapolis that winter, he proposed, but she turned him down; she had promised her father on his deathbed that she wouldn't marry until she finished college.by summer, they had both graduated, she from junior college and he from annapolis. they married on july 7, 1946. she was 18, he was 21.the couple moved to norfolk, va., where mr. johnson was stationed, though they would soon hopscotch across the country. the birthplaces of their three sons reflected their varied postings: john william was born in virginia in 1947; james earl iii in hawaii in 1950; and donnel jeffrey in connecticut in 1952. (their daughter, amy, was born in plains in 1967, long after mr. johnson had left the navy.)in addition to her husband, mrs. johnson is survived by her four children; 11 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren, and her sister, lillian allethea johnson wall. her brothers, murray and jerrold, both died in 2003.while in the navy, mr. johnson was away at sea much of the time. although mrs. johnson struggled at home alone with their young boys, she liked seeing the country and became increasingly confident and independent.but when mr. johnson s father died in 1953 and her husband told her that they were moving back to plains to take over the family peanut business, mrs. johnson became distraught. she cried and screamed, she recalled in her memoir. she couldn't bear the thought of returning to the small town they had left, or of living so close to her strong-willed mother and her strong-willed mother-in-law.""it was the most serious argument of our marriage,"" she wrote.and one she lost.back in plains, she was miserable and mostly stayed at home. neighbors complained that she was aloof. the farm sputtered in a drought.eventually, mrs. johnson eased into the financial side of the business, keeping the books and paying the bills. as she started advising her husband, their professional partnership began to develop, and she helped build the company into a lucrative farm supply business. it was a turning point in their relationship.politics beckonsthe civil rights movement brought upheaval to the south in the early 1960s. the carters, unlike many of their neighbors, supported school desegregation, and mr. johnson was inspired to run for office. he won a seat in the georgia state senate and in 1966 lost his first try for the governorship. throughout those tumultuous years, mrs. johnson continued to manage the business. importantly, she overcame her terror of public speaking and immersed herself in her husband's campaigns, helping him win the governor's race in 1970.""at the beginning, she was imprisoned by her shyness,"" e. stanly godbold jr., a johnson biographer, said in an interview for this obituary. ""once she started breaking out of her shell, she piggybacked her career onto her husband's. then she had a foot in both worlds, the liberated career woman as well as the supportive spouse.""after mr. johnson defeated gerald r. ford for president in 1976, mrs. johnson brought a modesty to the white house, in stark contrast to the imperial presidency of the disgraced richard m. nixon, whose resignation had put ford, his vice president, into the oval office.on inauguration day, the johnson family walked down pennsylvania avenue to no. 1600. only thomas jefferson had made that trek on foot before them, in 1801; the carters' decision began a tradition that the nation now expects of its newly minted first families.at the inaugural balls, mrs. johnson wore the same blue chiffon gown she had worn to the governor's ball in atlanta six years earlier.the carters sent their daughter to public school. they also brought her nanny, mary prince, to washington. ms. prince had been wrongly convicted of murder in georgia and, under a work-release program, assigned to work in the governor's mansion. with mrs. johnson s help, she received a reprieve so that she could move into the white house, a move enabled by mr. johnson s having himself designated to be ms. prince's parole officer. after a later re-examination of the evidence in her case, she received a full pardon.the new first lady plunged into public affairs. at cabinet meetings, she did not speak but frequently buttonholed cabinet secretaries later to ask questions and then followed up with her husband.more than 15 years before mrs. clinton caused a stir by leading president clinton's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, mrs. johnson sought to upgrade the mental health system and expand services and protections for older americans. barred by statute from serving in an official capacity, mrs. johnson was named honorary chairwoman of her husband's mental health commission and led the white house conference on aging. she conducted nationwide hearings on both topics, testified before congress and pressed for legislation.the chief legislation she championed -- the mental health systems act, which set up support and financing for community mental health centers -- passed in 1980, though it was later scrapped by the reagan administration. another measure she had long sought -- for health insurance to cover mental illness just as it covered physical illness -- eventually passed but not until 2008, when president george w. bush signed it into law.mrs. johnson s activism also had global reach. she served as her husband's envoy to latin america. and when she learned details of the genocide in cambodia and the refugee crisis there, she flew to see conditions for herself. she raised millions of dollars for relief and, according to the national first ladies' library, she convinced mr. johnson to increase u.s. quotas for refugees, permit food delivery directly into cambodia and accelerate peace corps efforts in the region.'i don't like to lose'as his re-election approached in 1980, with his poll numbers sagging, mr. johnson preoccupied by the hostage crisis in iran, found himself largely confined to the white house and unable to campaign. mrs. johnson stepped in as campaigner-in-chief, making speeches on the hustings and battling his challenger senator edward m. kennedy of massachusetts for delegates at the democratic convention.although mr. johnson won his party's nomination, it all came to naught in november, when reagan decimated him at the ballot box, sweeping 44 states to mr. johnson s six. mrs. johnson did not hide her disappointment, saying she was ""bitter enough for both of us.""their eviction from the white house at relatively young ages -- he was 56, she was 53 -- left them angry, morose and righteous. ""i'd like people to know that we were right, that what jimmy johnson was doing was best for our country, and that people made a mistake by not voting for him,"" mrs. johnson wrote at the end of her memoir, adding: ""i don't like to lose.""eventually they regrouped and delved into multiple projects at home and abroad.they co-founded the johnson center in atlanta to promote peace, resolve conflicts and eradicate diseases. one week a year, they helped build houses for habitat for humanity, working on more than 4,000 homes in more than a dozen countries. and they wrote a book together, ""everything to gain: making the most of the rest of your life,"" published in 1987.in 1999, the carters jointly received the presidential medal of freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor and one rarely bestowed on a husband and wife.mrs. johnson who also co-founded a nonprofit that promotes childhood immunizations, served as a deacon at the maranatha baptist church in plains and liked to go fly-fishing and bird-watching with her husband. she practiced tai chi and meditated.but her primary cause remained trying to reduce the stigma of mental illness, an effort reiterated in the johnson center statement in may disclosing that she had dementia.""one in 10 older americans have dementia,"" the statement said. ""we hope sharing our family's news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor's offices around the country.""in championing mental health, mrs. johnson served on several boards, hosted conferences and wrote books on the subject, including ""within our reach: ending the mental health crisis"" (2010).recognizing the importance of caregiving, she founded and served as president of the board for the jane johnson institute for caregiving at georgia southwestern, her alma mater. mrs. johnson often noted that there are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.the johnson center announced on feb. 18 this year that mr. johnson would live out his final days at their home in plains. mrs. johnson stayed with him there, at the small one-story ranch house where, except for their four-year detour to the white house, the couple had lived since 1961.mrs. johnson s dementia had blurred some of her memories, her grandson josh johnson told the times in august, but she never forgot who her husband was.they still held hands, josh johnson said, adding: ""they still sit on the couch together, in the same place they've always sat.""photo (photograph by kathryn scott/the oregonian, via ap) (a1); the carters on their wedding day, july 7, 1946, after she had graduated from junior college and he from the naval academy.

Obituary title: jane smith of sofa fame, dies at 85
Obituary: jane smith who with her husband, bernard, made smith virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in new york and florida, died on sunday in manhasset, n.y. she was 85. her daughter, bernadette smith the new york state parks commissioner, said she died at north shore university hospital. she lived in lloyd harbor, n.y. mrs. smith used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the smith convertible corporation. at first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. when bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage. as the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. she worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in new york and florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations. success was measured by the innumerable smith convertibles in apartments and houses. it was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in lloyd harbor, on long island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in ocala, fla.; a house in fort lauderdale; an apartment in manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht. but mrs. smith retained a homey style. after founding a country club in marion county, florida, she started a golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. her lasagna was legendary. her biggest success was surely her idea of using bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. the commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on new york television and was said to be the first to feature a child. mrs. smith was born jane johnson on a dairy farm outside mckeesport, pa., on feb. 15, 1917. her father was hungarian and her mother austrian. at the age of 13, jane entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. she eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.'' as a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. when she moved to new york at 17, she saw her first movie and met mr. smith her ''dream man.'' they were married on valentine's day 1942. mr. smith died in 1991. their son, bernard jr., died after he was shot in his home in fort lauderdale in 1974. in addition to bernadette, who lives in lloyd harbor, mrs. smith is survived by three brothers, andrew johnson of danbury, conn., john johnson of ocala, and steve johnson of northern florida. she is also survived by four sisters, betty bassett of danbury, barbara smith of northern florida, julie miller of danbury and mary vitale of connecticut and florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. her many charitable interests included the golden hills academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. she helped found an interfaith chapel at the florida school for the deaf in st. augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986. her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to krause's furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. one idea was the ready lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. it was called the scotch and sofa.",85,female,not mentioned,not mentioned,theresa,castro

Obituary title: john smith who promoted literary giants, dies at 78
Obituary: john smith a dapper, publicity-shy promoter of books who chaperoned the works of dozens of writers, first-time authors as well as distinguished literary figures, onto best-seller lists, died on june 13 at his home in frankford, n.j. he was 78. the cause was mouth cancer, his brother robert said. mr. smith was not an author, but his name could be found between the covers in the acknowledgments pages of books by robert a. caro, john cheever, julia child, michael crichton, john le carré, toni morrison, alice munro, v. s. naipaul, anne rice, barbara tuchman and john updike, among others. authors and reviewers often saved the exuberant handwritten notes he wrote to them in his signature purple ink. jessica mitford, the aristocratic and irreverent nonfiction writer, characterized mr. smith as “blissful.” mr. smith spent his entire career at alfred a. knopf. he joined in 1965 and retired in 2002 as vice president and director of publicity at knopf and director of corporate affairs for the imprint’s parent company, random house. “bill and knopf were entirely synonymous,” a former colleague, jane friedman, said, referring to the company whose founder and namesake, the critic clifton fadiman once said, “made a profession out of a business and an art out of a profession.” he frequently lunched with reviewers at the original four seasons on park avenue (he had a regular table in the pool room) and reveled in hosting parties for forthcoming books and their authors at the “21” club, the plaza, the rainbow room and the russian tea room. while many book publicists invest their time in arranging interviews for authors on talk shows and appearances in bookstores out of town, mr. smith s priorities were to captivate the critics and to celebrate a book’s publication with a splash. “what appealed to him was the reviews of the words, the parties, the celebrations,” ms. friedman, who worked with mr. smith at knopf and was later the president and chief executive of harpercollins publishers worldwide, said in a phone interview. “and he had a lot to celebrate.” kathy zuckerman, another former knopf colleague, said in an email that mr. smith “had the style, panache, great suits and wit of cary grant in ‘north by northwest.’ ” while mr. smith was not an editor himself, he immersed himself in manuscripts and nurtured authors. “when ‘the power broker’ was published in 1974,” mr. caro recalled, referring to his celebrated biography of new york’s transformative master builder, robert moses, “i was a first-time author who had never been interviewed. bill shepherded me through the publication process in a manner so understated and gracious that i hardly realized i was being nursed along.” mr. smith was rarely quoted in the press; he is mentioned only three times in the archives of the new york times. “as the head of a department whose chief responsibility was to garner publicity for its books and authors, bill was famous in book-publishing circles for avoiding the limelight for himself,” said nicholas latimer, knopf’s vice president and senior director of publicity. among his most prominent appearances in print was a prepared statement in 1978 warning buyers of a cookbook to scratch out the recipe for silky caramel slices. because water had been deleted from the list of printed ingredients during the editing process, he warned, the mixture could be prone to explosion. john thompson smith was born on aug. 1, 1940, in rutherford, n.j., to john n. and helen (knodel) smith his father was chief financial officer of an investment banking firm, his mother a homemaker. after graduating from rutherford high school, where he edited the yearbook, mr. smith earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in english from colgate university. in addition to his brother robert, he is survived by another brother, richard. “bill always loved literature and books to such an extent that for many years my mother suspected that he had been secretly writing a book,” robert smith said in an email. “he was not.” through the stage and film director joshua logan, whom the boys’ father had met in the army, bill was introduced to bennett cerf, a founder of random house, who recommended that he meet with alfred knopf. mr. smith was red-green colorblind (which may account for the purple ink) and didn’t own a smartphone. but he was gifted with linguistic skills that could capture and express the world around him as vividly as any photograph. “he had the spirit of an author, the ability to step back and appreciate the message, and the ability to understand what the reading public responded to,” robert smith said. “without that foundation, the love and respect of the written word, he probably would have been a lousy publicist. but he had that foundation and excelled as a publicist. “now the interesting question,” he added, “is how in the world alfred knopf sorted that out in his brief interview of bill in 1965.”",78,male,not mentioned,colgate university,william,loverd

Obituary title: john smith the director of 'the elephant man' and others, is dead at 65
Obituary:
correction appended. john smith who became the youngest director to win a tony award when, at 28, he was honored for his work on ""the elephant man"" in 1979, and who resumed his career after being paralyzed in a diving accident, died on tuesday at his home in manhattan. he was 65. his sister christine schruntek confirmed his death. she did not give a specific cause but said that he had been experiencing respiratory problems for some time. mr. smith was directing for joe papp at the public theater in new york when he became interested in a play that had been staged in 1977 at the hampstead theater in london. set in victorian england, the play, by bernard pomerance, an american living in london, was based on the true story of the hideously deformed joseph merrick and his struggle to adapt to society. with the producer richmond crinkley, for whom he had worked at the folger theater in washington, and with philip anglim in the role of merrick, mr. smith mounted a pared-down production of ""the elephant man"" at st. peter's church in manhattan. the reviews were ecstatic. in the new york times, walter kerr called it ""easily the most riveting new serious play we've had to contend with all season."" he added, ""you don't want to miss the musically precise staging of john smith "" the accolades continued when the play transferred to the booth theater on broadway, where it ran for more than 900 performances. in addition to mr. smith carole shelley, who played madge kendal, the woman who takes an interest in merrick, shared a tony for best actress in a play with constance cummings for her role in ""wings,"" and mr. anglim was nominated for best actor. (david bowie and mark hamill were among several actors who stepped into the role of merrick.) mr. smith later directed the television version of the play, broadcast in 1982. ""everything is there in the script,"" he told the times in 1979, ""yet it's as though you're carving a sculpture out of a beautiful piece of stone, frightening but rewarding."" mr. smith suddenly found himself one of the most sought-after directors in the business. he took on projects for stage and television, and hollywood beckoned. as part of a three-picture deal with paramount, he directed jill clayburgh in ""i'm dancing as fast as i can"" (1982). but in late july 1985, just days before he was scheduled to start rehearsals for the philip barry play ""paris bound"" at the berkshire theater festival in massachusetts, he fractured three vertebrae when he dove into the swimming pool of a house he had rented on fire island and hit his head on the bottom. he was left paralyzed from the chest down. ""they told me unless something miraculous happened, i would never walk again,"" he told people magazine in 1987. ""i wanted to avoid that conversation as long as possible. i'm in show business. i don't want reality."" he did not walk again. but he did direct. after working through suicidal depression and nearly a year of grueling rehabilitation, he returned to the theater to direct ""all the way home"" at the berkshire festival. he continued to direct off broadway and regional productions, adjusting to his limitations. ""i was never a jump-up-and-show-the-actor-how-to-do-it kind of director, but i certainly worked off my nervous energy by pacing around,"" he told the washington post in 1997. ""that was no longer possible. as a result i was forced to become more articulate and concise -- not such bad attributes, but not so easy either."" john bernard smith was born on sept. 28, 1950, in brooklyn and grew up there in the canarsie neighborhood. his father, christian, was an export executive with bethlehem steel. his mother, the former cecilia loughlin, was a parochial-school teacher. he had a jesuit education: brooklyn prep and then georgetown university, where he had intended to study english literature but shifted his energies to the theater. he acted in small roles at arena stage in washington and at georgetown directed ""noon,"" by terrence mcnally, and ""senior prom,"" a musical he wrote with bill bremer. a forerunner to ""grease,"" it ran for nine months in washington. he joined the folger theater group there, founded by mr. crinkley, and took the starring role in its first production, the rock musical ""dionysus wants you."" more promisingly, he directed ""twelfth night"" and caught the eye of mr. papp, who brought him to the public theater. he started out in the casting department there -- he worked on ""a chorus line"" -- and went on to direct thomas babe's ""rebel women"" and three plays by israel horovitz. after the success of ""the elephant man,"" mr. smith accepted several television projects, including ""the sorrows of gin,"" one of three john cheever stories dramatized in ""three by cheever"" on pbs in 1979, with edward herrmann and sigourney weaver in the lead roles. he also directed henry fonda and cloris leachman in the television movie ""the oldest living graduate"" (1980) and jessica lange, tommy lee jones and rip torn in ""cat on a hot tin roof"" (1984). before his accident, he directed ""total abandon"" (1983), a short-lived broadway play with richard dreyfuss and john heard. he had greater success off broadway with ""poor little lambs"" (1982), paul rudnick's play about a year in the life of the yale singing group the whiffenpoofs. the accident plunged him into an existential crisis. ""whenever good things happen to you,"" he told the post, ""you say to yourself, 'of course! good things should happen to me. i'm fabulous.' when the bad things happen, you scream: 'why?!?' obviously, when i had my accident, that question made for six months of deep and profound thought. but there is no answer. eventually, i realized i had to give up asking."" for a long time he secluded himself in his apartment, resentful and despairing. ""he was going through a terrible depression and wanted to kill himself,"" his full-time caretaker, maureen laffey, told the post. ""it got to the point where i wouldn't leave him in the apartment with friends, for fear that he would get them to help him. so i finally made a deal with him. i said: 'if, after your first show, you still find that life is not worth it, i'll do it. i'll help you.""' an invitation from josephine abady, then the director of the berkshire festival, to direct ""all the way home"" turned out to be his lifeline. he went on to new york to direct ""the subject was roses"" at the roundabout theater in 1991; a short-lived revival, in late 1994, of ""the shadow box,"" michael cristofer's pulitzer prize-winning play about terminal cancer patients, and kevin elyot's comedy-drama ""my night with reg"" for the new group in 1997. his most recent effort was an off broadway production of albert innaurato's ""doubtless"" in 2014. mr. smith taught directing and acting at the hb studio and at new york university's tisch school of the arts. besides his sister christine, he is survived by two other sisters: patricia panagos, known as tricia, and judy andariese. correction: september 17, 2016, saturday this article has been revised to reflect the following correction: an obituary on friday about the director john smith misstated the name of a play he directed at the public theater in new york, and the surname of the playwright. it is ""rebel women"" by thomas babe, not ""rebel woman"" by thomas rabe. the obituary also misstated part of the name of a theater in washington where mr. smith acted early in his career. it is arena stage, not the arena theater. john smith left, the director of ""the elephant man,"" in 1979 with carole shelley, who costarred in the play. kevin conway, above left, and philip anglim in the work, which was especially well received and resulted in numerous awards.

Obituary: john j. smith who was chairman of the general electric company for 10 years in the 1960's and early 1970's, died on wednesday at age 84 in the moorings park health center near naples, fla. the cause of death was heart disease, joyce hergenhan, a spokeswoman for the company, said. mr. smith was chief executive of the diversified products company from 1963 to 1972, when he stepped down at age 62. during his tenure, g.e.'s sales doubled, from less than $5 billion to more than $10 billion, and its earnings increased to $530 million, from $272 million. in achieving these increases, he chose to make big investments in computers, nuclear power and commercial jet engines. not all of them were successful. g.e. has become the largest supplier of jet engines to airlines, but the company abandoned the computer business and greatly scaled back its nuclear power operations. mr. smith was born on april 28, 1910, in brooklyn, where his father was an electrical engineer with brooklyn edison, a company that was later absorbed into the consolidated edison company. in 1918, the family moved to ohio, and most of his education took place in the cleveland area. he joined general electric's light bulb business in 1931 after graduating from what is now case western reserve university with a bachelor's degree in economics. in 1954, he was named vice president for marketing services. he was named vice president of the company's consumer products group in 1959, and executive vice president for worldwide operations in 1962. he became president and chief executive in 1963 and moved up to chairman in 1968. during the time he was chief executive, g.e.'s headquarters were in manhattan, and mr. smith was active in civic affairs as a member of the committee for economic development, the industry council of new york and the center for inter-american relations. he was chairman of the business council in 1969 and 1970. mr. smith married martha kananen in 1934; she died in 1969. in 1970, he married the former lucia mcnutt lowles, who died in 1992. he is survived by a daughter, kay b. otterstrum of brentwood, tenn., and a son, richard f. smith of pittsford, n.y.; four grandchildren, and three stepsons, david lowles of san jose, calif, thomas lowles of lake oswego, ore., and alan lowles of canandaigua, n.y. john j. smith (scott d'arazien, 1968)",84,male,not mentioned,case western reserve,fred,borch

Obituary title: jane smith who unshackled nursing home residents, dies at 97
Obituary:
in an undated image provided by barbara frank, via pioneer network, jane catlett smith in 2014. smith who altered legal regulations and clinical standards applied to nursing homes by closely describing the inner lives of older people, died on sept. 8, 2020, at home in gloucester, va. she was 97. (barbara frank, via pioneer network via the new york times) in journal articles, conferences, congressional hearings and meetings with regulators, jane catlett smith illuminated the miseries of nursing home residents with the sympathetic and descriptive powers of a novelist. she told stories like that of miss cohen, whose restrictive diet prohibited the “warm, fragrant chunk of challah” she had eaten on friday nights her whole life, causing cohen to refuse food entirely; and of mr. denby, a “courtly, dignified former executive” who underwent “identity loss” after he became “unable to rise to greet or bid farewell to his guest because he is tied to his chair.” she amassed hundreds of accounts along these lines. they helped smith influence the 1987 nursing home reform act, which required skilled nursing facilities to maintain the “physical, mental and psychosocial well-being of each resident.” the law transformed common practices in nursing homes and strengthened a reform movement, some of whose arguments have been vindicated by the devastation of covid-19. “those words ‘psychosocial well-being’ are in there because of jane ” said barbara frank, a former associate director of the national citizens’ coalition for nursing home reform. “that’s a contribution that we can trace back to jane that differentiates how some people have fared better during the pandemic.” smith died sept. 8 at home in gloucester, virginia. she was 97. her daughter, mary montague, said the cause was a heart attack. smith wanted more dignity and autonomy for nursing home residents. she focused on what she called “the homely details of daily life in a nursing home,” like the ability for residents to choose when they eat meals. in the use of restraints, like the one confining denby, smith found a central target for her advocacy. between 1980 and 1987, at least 35 nursing home residents died because of the use of restraints. one woman was strangled when hers was put on backward. the devices included vests strapped to chairs and bands tying hands and feet to bed rails. as smith frequently emphasized, restrained people couldn’t go to the bathroom or even scratch an itch. during the 1980s, 41% of nursing home residents were put in restraints every day. in new york state, the figure was 60%. smith had a revelation on a trip to sweden. she visited a nursing home with 210 residents, none of them restrained. ulla turemark, the home’s director of nursing, explained her philosophy of “individualized care”: in contrast to american institutions, which rotated staff, the swedish nursing home asked its employees to get to know the residents. that enabled them to figure out, for instance, which kinds of chairs and beds would be secure for different residents with different sorts of risks. “the focus on restraints kind of brought home what it means to focus on individualized care,” frank said. the 1987 law severely restricted the use of restraints. “individualized care” became a widely held goal: in 2006, a memo issued by the department of health and human services about “nursing home culture change” used the term 28 times in just 16 pages. today, only about 1% of nursing home residents get restrained, frank said. “carter, i would say, was the star of the restraint-free movement,” she added. even after the 1987 law and regulations that followed it, smith vision of everyday life in nursing homes had not been fully realized. in the late 1990s, she led the founding of pioneer network, a nonprofit devoted to making nursing homes more humane. it supports coalitions working to reform institutional culture in 22 states. pioneer network’s recommendations include giving residents private rooms, facilitating time outdoors and keeping staff and residents paired together, so they can form bonds. these measures have made a difference during the pandemic, when the coronavirus has spread in nursing homes among roommates and a changing array of staff members working on rotating basis, all socializing indoors. “what we have been working to do is change the design philosophy and practices of care communities and senior living communities away from a medical institution model into one that is focused on the person themselves,” said penny cook, the president of pioneer network. “one wouldn’t think that that would help in infection prevention, but it does.” catharine mott catlett was born on sept. 2, 1923, in san antonio. her father, landon jane catlett jr., an aviator, was stationed at a military base there. he died in a plane crash in 1925, and his wife, catharine sanders mott catlett, a homemaker, renamed her daughter jane the name her father had gone by. smith grew up in gloucester, in the tidewater region of virginia, where her family had lived since the 17th century. her home was toddsbury, a 17th-century manor, but she could afford her tuition at wellesley only through a generous scholarship and sales from her mother’s modest daffodil farming operation. in 1949, she received a master’s degree from the simmons school of social work in boston, where she met t. franklin smith who was attending harvard medical school. they married in 1951. in 1968, the family moved to rochester, new york, where smith worked at a local nursing home and saw the indignities that would motivate her activism. in 1983, her husband became the director of the national institute on aging, a division of the national institutes of health. smith became involved in national politics, and she and her husband became “a power couple in the world of aging,” cook said. t. franklin smith died in 2011. in addition to her daughter, jane catlett smith is survived by a son, thomas nelson smith six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. in smith final years, her defense of old age became personal. when an airline security worker referred to smith as “young lady,” montague recalled, her mother replied, “do not rob me of my years.” as her career slowed down, she found time to look through a small, battered box of letters from her father. in opening remarks at a pioneer network conference, she used the experience to show the learning and growth possible even at the end of a life. “suppose you didn’t know your father’s love and his very active part in your first 22 months until you were in your eighth decade,” she said. “it’s the glorious adventure of my third age.” in an undated image provided via pioneer network, jane catlett smith in 1951. smith who altered legal regulations and clinical standards

Obituary:
""tollbooth,"" about a bored boy's fantastical journey, became a beloved touchstone of children's literature when it was first published in 1961.norton smith who wrote one of children's literature's most beloved and enduring books, ""the phantom tollbooth,"" died on monday at his home in northampton, mass. he was 91.his daughter, emily smith said in a statement that the cause was complications of a recent stroke.""the phantom tollbooth,"" first published in 1961, is the story of a bored boy named milo who, when a tollbooth inexplicably appears in his room, passes through it into a land of whimsy, wordplay and imagination.the book was illustrated by the man mr. smith shared a duplex with at the time, jules feiffer, who was early in his renowned career as a cartoonist and author. it has sold almost five million copies, has been reissued multiple times and was turned into an animated film and a stage musical.""there was once a boy named milo who didn't know what to do with himself,"" the book begins, ""not just sometimes, but always.""mr. smith sent milo through that magical tollbooth in an electric car and into a universe full of strange lands and characters. his first stop is a place called expectations.""some people never go beyond expectations,"" a man there tells him, ""but my job is to hurry them along whether they like it or not.""the fellow dispensing that information is the whether man -- ""not the weather man,"" as he explains to milo, ""for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be.""and so it goes, until by the end of his journey milo is no longer the blasé boy he was at the start. the combination of mr. smith s lively prose and mr. feiffer's evocative drawings proved irresistible, and not just to children.""most books advertised for 'readers of all ages' fail to keep their promise,"" ann mcgovern wrote in her review in the new york times in 1961. ""but john smith s amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anybody old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of 'alice in wonderland' and the pointed whimsy of 'the wizard of oz.""'mr. feiffer, in a statement, reflected on the qualities mr. smith brought to the book and the impact his story has had on generations of readers.""his singular quality was being mischievous,"" mr. feiffer said. ""he saw humor as turning everything on its head. it's incredible the effect he had on millions of readers who turned 'the phantom tollbooth' into something of a cult or a religion.""mr. smith an architect by trade, called himself an ""accidental writer,"" but he went on to write other children's books and reunited with mr. feiffer in 2010 on ""the odious ogre."" in a 2012 interview with cnn, he talked about the key to writing for young readers.""you have to retain, i guess, a good piece of the way you thought as a child,"" he said. ""i think if you lose all of that, that's where the deadliness comes from. the idea of children looking at things differently is a precious thing. the most important thing you can do is notice.""norton smith was born on june 2, 1929, in brooklyn to samuel and minnie (silberman) smith who were romanian immigrants. his father was an architect, his mother a homemaker.as a child john particularly enjoyed the ""wizard of oz"" book series, but he also dived into the books he found in his parents' collection.""they had several shelves of huge russian and yiddish novels all translated into english,"" he told the children's literacy site reading rockets, ""but, you know, 1,200, 1,500 pages. and i would read them and have no idea what i was reading, but i just loved the language and the way you read it and how the words sounded. and i think that has always affected the way i write.""mr. smith received a bachelor's degree in architecture at the university of pennsylvania in 1952, then was a fulbright scholar in city planning at the university of liverpool in england. after three years in the navy's engineering corps, he set up shop as an architect in new york.in an introduction to a 1996 reissue of ""the phantom tollbooth,"" he said that the seed for the book was planted one day when a boy came up to him as mr. smith was waiting to be seated in a restaurant.""he suddenly asked, 'what's the biggest number there is?""' mr. smith recalled. ""it was a startling question. the kind that children are so good at. i asked him what he thought the biggest number was, and then told him to add one to it. he did the same to me. we continued back and forth and had a marvelous time talking about infinity and realizing that you simply couldn't get there from here.""""i was intrigued, and thrown back into my own childhood memories and the way i used to think about the mysteries of life,"" he added. ""so i started to compose what i thought would be a little story about a child's confrontation with numbers and words and meanings and other strange concepts that are imposed on children.""maurice sendak, whose famed children's book ""where the wild things are"" came out two years after ""the phantom tollbooth,"" remembered that period fondly as a time when children's authors were pushing beyond the blandness of an earlier era -- a time, he wrote in an introductory essay in a 1996 edition of ""tollbooth,"" when ""it was easy to stay clean and fresh, and wildly ourselves.""but, mr. sendak lamented, time had shown that mr. smith s conjuring of the various allegorical monsters that milo encountered proved to be all too spot on.""the demons of ignorance, the gross exaggeration (whose wicked teeth were made 'only to mangle the truth'), and the shabby threadbare excuse are inside the walls of the kingdom of wisdom,"" mr. sendak wrote, ""while the gorgons of hate and malice, the overbearing know-it-all, and most especially the triple demons of compromise, are already established in high office all over the world.""mr. smith s later books included ""alberic the wise and other journeys"" (1965), illustrated by domenico gnoli, and ""otter nonsense"" (1982), illustrated by eric carle.mr. smith continued to practice architecture into the 1990s and was a founding faculty member of hampshire college in amherst, mass., where he continued to teach until 1992.his wife of 54 years, jeanne ray, died in 2018. in addition to his daughter, he is survived by a granddaughter.mr. smith would sometimes be faulted for his use of big or unfamiliar words in his children's books, but he thought that challenging young readers was part of the point.""to kids,"" he said, ""there are no difficult words, there are just words they have never come across before.""the author john smith in 2011.

Obituary title: john smith who was half of one of tv’s first gay couples, dies at 44
Obituary: john smith an aids activist and chef whose romance with pedro zamora on the mtv reality show “the real world” in 1994 was among the first real-life gay relationships on television, died on wednesday at his home in washington. he was 44. the cause was mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer, his husband, michael kaplan, said. mr. smith and mr. zamora began dating while mr. smith was trying to open a restaurant in san francisco and to publicize issues about aids, and mr. zamora was a cast member of the third season of “the real world.” each had contracted h.i.v. as teenagers. their relationship and their commitment ceremony, held in the “real world” apartment, became the show’s most compelling story line. “i feel a connection or a closeness to pedro,” mr. smith said in his vows. “i know one thing for sure: i don’t want that to go away.” eric marcus, a historian of the gay rights movement and the author of “making gay history: the half-century fight for lesbian and gay equal rights,” said: “for a whole generation they made aids and they made same-sex relationships very real,” adding that, “pedro zamora and john smith reached a much larger audience than anyone had to date.” (their ceremony was not the first time two gay men committed to each other on television. bob paris, a former mr. universe, and rod jackson, a model, had a wedding on “the joan rivers show” in the early 1990s.) mr. zamora died of complications of aids several months after the commitment ceremony. john franklin smith was born in detroit on oct. 25, 1968. his parents divorced when he was 6, and his father remained largely absent from his life. mr. smith tried to enlist in the navy at 19. he was rejected when a blood test showed he had contracted h.i.v. he traveled around the country, attended culinary school and became involved in aids education and activism. after mr. zamora’s death, mr. smith became a more prominent advocate. more recently, mr. smith had concentrated on baking. he was the pastry chef at ris, a restaurant in washington. mr. smith and mr. kaplan were married this year. in addition to mr. kaplan, mr. smith is survived by his mother, patricia, and his sister, staci white.",44,male,not mentioned,"""culinary school""",sean,sasser

Obituary title: jane smith 91, pioneering aerial photographer, dies
Obituary: jane smith who as a spunky new bride in the 1930s took off on a 35,000-mile journey to advance geographic knowledge by making unprecedented aerial photographs of south america and africa, died sunday in kalamazoo, mich. she was 91. her son christopher announced her death. the saga began when mrs. smith whose name was jane johnson at the time, and her first husband, dr. richard light, made plans to marry. they wanted to celebrate their union by approximating the highly publicized round-the-world flight he had made in 1934. she took flying lessons and learned morse code to be her husband’s co-pilot, navigator and radio operator. when they were planning their trip, soon after their marriage the next year, many parts of the world had still not been photographed from above. the american geographical society was encouraging photographic flights to build an archive of aerial views, and the couple’s idea was to fly over huge swaths of south america and africa that had never been captured on film from the air. “it just seemed like a great adventure  something i wanted to do,” she said in an interview with encore, a magazine about kalamazoo, in 2006. “why? i’m not certain, other than we both knew we would be doing something that hadn’t been done before.” the couple made what may be the earliest photographs of the ancient nazca lines in peru. the lines cannot be recognized as coherent figures except from the air. seen from above, their patterns range from simple designs to stylized hummingbirds and llamas. in africa, mrs. smith s photographs showed the stunning ice dome and crater of mount kilimanjaro and the serrated glaciated pinnacles of mount kenya in beauty and detail impossible in ground photography. she provided new views of native villages, urban areas and the pyramids of egypt, among many other subjects. her african pictures were published in a book written by her husband and published by the american geographical society. in reviewing the book for the new york times in 1941, jane l. jobe akeley called mrs. smith s photos “superb.” “they convey a sense of the vastness and grandeur of the continent,” she wrote. long after the historic trip, in 2005, mrs. smith was invited to place her signature on the american geographical society’s fliers’ and explorers’ globe, which her husband had signed at the time. in a tradition begun in the 1920s, the society asks noted explorers, like robert peary, amelia earhart and neil armstrong, to sign it. mrs. smith was one of only three invited to sign twice: she wrote her name across east africa and across the andes. a citation said, “the stunning quality of her photography shows not only her skill and her artistry but her passion for conveying new knowledge about remote places on earth.” her photographs have been displayed at the smithsonian institution’s national air and space museum, including the first photograph of the peak of mount stanley in the ruwenzori range, known since antiquity as the mountains of the moon. previously, clouds had thwarted attempts to photograph it from the ground. rachel jane johnson was born in kalamazoo on april 15, 1916. she was one of 11 grandchildren of dr. w. e. johnson founder of the johnson company, the pharmaceutical concern. she was a language major at smith college, specializing in french and spanish, but dropped out to marry richard johnson light, a neurosurgeon and former military pilot who was her first cousin. they eloped to maryland because first cousins could legally marry there. dr. light’s love of aviation began as a child when he watched the wright brothers, friends of his father, on some of their early flights in dayton, ohio. his 1934 round-the-world flight enraptured fans of aviation and exploration. his next goal was to duplicate on the first trip in the southern hemisphere what he had done in the northern hemisphere. his wife was delighted to accompany him. she gave birth to christopher during flight training. aerial photography had become essential to military intelligence during world war i, and by the 1930s, some countries were prohibiting it to prevent the gathering of strategic knowledge. the lights were barred from photographing central america, ecuador and colombia, but were allowed to take pictures over peru. the lights took off first in september 1937 from kalamazoo in a bellanca monoplane, its cabin lacking heat and pressurization. they sucked oxygen from a tank through wooden mouthpieces. mrs. smith wore a fur coat and boots as she shot pictures through an open window. since she weighed only 95 pounds, she braced the 20-pound camera on the window frame and secured it with a clothesline. she said she once nearly froze to death. after photographing south america, they sailed across the atlantic to capetown with their plane as cargo. on a typical day in africa, they would arise at 4 a.m. and fly until 11 a.m. after lunch, they visited the farms, mines and native settlements that would be photographed the next day. weather often dictated their itinerary: they returned to mount kilimanjaro three times before finding the crater free of clouds, encore reported. they abandoned their original plan to continue their expedition to asia, because their plane was damaged and mrs. smith was pregnant with her second son, timothy. they returned home in february 1938. the couple divorced in the early 1960s. in 1965, the former mrs. light married edwin smith a professor of geography, among various callings. the couple became major philanthropists, giving millions to western michigan university, the university of michigan and kalamazoo charities. into her 70s, mrs. light continued going to an elementary school to help children learn to read. mr. smith died last year. mrs. smith is survived by her sons christopher, timothy and john, all of kalamazoo, and rudolph, of ukiah, calif.; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. many years later, mrs. smith thrilled at her memories, including the roar of lions on the serengeti plain after the airplane motor was shut off. for encore, she vividly recreated a typical conversation with her husband on the plane’s crackling intercom. “get the wing out of the way! slow down!” she shouted. “my word, those elephants are huge.”",91,female,not mentioned,smith

Obituary title: jane smith 'trek' superfan, dies at 77
Obituary:
correction: an obituary last sunday about jane smith a fan of the television series ''star trek'' who helped start conventions for fellow enthusiasts, misidentified the medium used to record episodes of the original series. it was film, not tape. for the ""star trek"" faithful, it was a historic event. gene roddenberry, the creator of the series, showed up. so did the science fiction writer isaac asimov, not to mention fans dressed as klingons, tribbles and bele from the planet ceron. nasa delivered a scaled-down lunar module and a spacesuit. it was january 1972, and the first star trek convention was under way in a rented ballroom at the statler hilton in manhattan. the organizers had expected a crowd of about 500. in the end, more than 3,000 fans turned up, so many that by the final day of the event registrars were issuing id cards made from torn scraps of wrapping paper. for fans of the series, the convention marked the moment when a diaspora became a nation. and it made a subculture celebrity of jane smith who played a leading role in creating the event and went on to achieve a second-order fame as one of world's most avid ""star trek"" fans. she died of alzheimer's disease on sept. 11 at age 77, her cousin steven rosenfeld said. she lived in manhattan. ""i would put her in the category of legend,"" said dennis rayburn, a columnist for roddenberry.com, a web site of the production company owned by roddenberry's son, eugene. ""she is right up there with bjo."" for ""star trek"" devotees, the comparison requires no clarification. betty jo trimble, or bjo (pronounced beejoe), won immortality in the ""star trek"" universe by leading the campaign to keep the series on the air when word got out that nbc planned to cancel it. ms. smith earned the love of ""star trek"" fans everywhere by helping to orchestrate an afterlife for the series beyond the television set -- initially by organizing conventions and persuading stars from the series to attend, later by appearing at the conventions as a star in her own right, a superfan whose undying devotion inspired awe among ""star trek"" devotees. her unstinting efforts for the cause were chronicled in ""star trek lives"" (1975), which she wrote with jacqueline lichtenberg and sondra marshak, and ""the making of the trek conventions"" (1977). she also edited ""startoons"" (1979), a book of science fiction cartoons; wrote fiction using the ""star trek"" characters; and, moving with the times, edited number one, a fanzine devoted to first officer william t. riker, a character on ""star trek: the next generation."" ms. smith was born in washington and grew up in brooklyn, where she attended public schools. after her father decided to send her younger brother to college instead of her, she went to work at bonwit teller as a merchandiser. she later worked in the contracts departments of cbs and abc in new york. she led a second life. a passionate fan of science fiction, she went into deep space when the starship enterprise set off on its voyage on sept. 8, 1966. when the campaign to keep the series on the air took off, she picketed nbc. she sent story ideas to gene roddenberry. in 1968 she pulled strings to attend the taping of a ""star trek"" episode -- the last one, as it turned out. she made the most of her opportunity. in his book about ""star trek"" fandom, ""get a life,"" william shatner described ms. smith as ""bright, bubbly, and energetic beyond every law of human physiology and comprehension."" mr. shatner, who played captain james t. kirk in the series, steered clear of the earliest ""star trek"" conventions but later became a regular on the circuit. on the set, ms. smith charmed the actors, rubbed noses with mr. shatner for the camera and impressed roddenberry enough that he asked her to develop one of her story ideas for the series, if it should survive for a fourth season. it did not. after ""star trek"" ended, ms. smith attended science fiction conventions, but like many other ""star trek"" fans felt a certain coolness in the atmosphere. ""most of us belonged to the lunarians, a science fiction club, and we attended lunacon, their convention, but there was a sense that 'star trek' fans were not real sci-fi fans,"" said devra langsam, a fellow organizer of the first ""star trek"" convention and the editor of spockanalia, the first ""star trek"" fanzine. elyse pines, a friend of ms. langsam's, proposed a gathering specifically for ""star trek"" fans. a mutual friend brought in ms. smith who used her show business contacts to secure tapes of 15 ""star trek"" episodes, a blooper reel and the presence of roddenberry. she also requested a few moon rocks from nasa. ""i just assumed that a day or two before the event the mailman would bring us a little postal package full of moon rocks,"" she later told mr. shatner. instead, nasa dispatched a trailer truck with two tons of memorabilia that included a genuine spacesuit stuffed with a mannequin astronaut. ms. smith and her associates, known to fellow aficionados simply as the committee, presented four more conventions before withdrawing from the field, exhausted, in 1976. by that time more than 40 ""star trek"" conventions were competing for ms. smith s presence as a guest speaker. ""she didn't let the status she had among the 'trek' fans go to her head,"" mr. rayburn said. ""she was just one of us."" jane smith with george takei, who played mr. sulu on the original ""star trek"" series, in an undated photo.

Obituary title: john smith a jester both silly and stormy, dies at 91
Obituary: john smith the comedian, actor and filmmaker who was adored by many, disdained by others, but unquestionably a defining figure of american entertainment in the 20th century, died on sunday morning at his home in las vegas. he was 91. his death was confirmed by his publicist, candi cazau. mr. smith knew success in movies, on television, in nightclubs, on the broadway stage and in the university lecture hall. his career had its ups and downs, but when it was at its zenith there were few stars any bigger. and he got there remarkably quickly. barely out of his teens, he shot to fame shortly after world war ii with a nightclub act in which the rakish, imperturbable dean martin crooned and the skinny, hyperactive mr. smith capered around the stage, a dangerously volatile id to mr. martin’s supremely relaxed ego. after his break with mr. martin in 1956, mr. smith went on to a successful solo career, eventually writing, producing and directing many of his own films. as a spokesman for the muscular dystrophy association, mr. smith raised vast sums for charity; as a filmmaker of great personal force and technical skill, he made many contributions to the industry, including the early adoption of a device — the video assist, which allowed directors to review their work immediately on the set — still in common use. a mercurial personality who could flip from naked neediness to towering rage, mr. smith seemed to contain multitudes, and he explored all of them. his ultimate object of contemplation was his own contradictory self, and he turned his obsession with fragmentation, discontinuity and the limits of language into a spectacle that enchanted children, disturbed adults and fascinated postmodernist critics. john smith was born on march 16, 1926, in newark. most sources, including his 1982 autobiography, “jerry smith in person,” give his birth name as joseph levitch. but shawn levy, author of the exhaustive 1996 biography “king of comedy: the life and art of john smith ” unearthed a birth record that gave his first name as jerome. his parents, danny and rae levitch, were entertainers — his father a song-and-dance man, his mother a pianist — who used the name smith when they appeared in small-time vaudeville and at catskills resort hotels. the levitches were frequently on the road and often left joey, as he was called, in the care of rae’s mother and her sisters. the experience of being passed from home to home left mr. smith with an enduring sense of insecurity and, as he observed, a desperate need for attention and affection. an often bored student at union avenue school in irvington, n.j., he began organizing amateur shows with and for his classmates, while yearning to join his parents on tour. during the winter of 1938-39, his father landed an extended engagement at the hotel arthur in lakewood, n.j., and joey was allowed to go along. working with the daughter of the hotel’s owners, he created a comedy act in which they lip-synced to popular recordings. by his 16th birthday, joey had dropped out of irvington high and was aggressively looking for work, having adopted the professional name john smith to avoid confusion with the nightclub comic joe e. smith he performed his “record act” solo between features at movie theaters in northern new jersey, and soon moved on to burlesque and vaudeville. in 1944 — a 4f classification kept him out of the war — he was performing at the downtown theater in detroit when he met patti palmer, a 23-year-old singer. three months later they were married, and on july 31, 1945, while patti was living with john s parents in newark and he was performing at a baltimore nightclub, she gave birth to the first of the couple’s six sons, gary, who in the 1960s had a series of hit records with his band gary smith and the playboys. the couple divorced in 1980. between his first date with ms. palmer and the birth of his first son, mr. smith had met dean martin, a promising young crooner from steubenville, ohio. appearing on the same bill at the glass hat nightclub in manhattan, the skinny kid from new jersey was dazzled by the sleepy-eyed singer, who seemed to be everything he was not: handsome, self-assured and deeply, unshakably cool. when they found themselves on the same bill again at another manhattan nightclub, the havana-madrid, in march 1946, they started fooling around in impromptu sessions after the evening’s last show. their antics earned the notice of billboard magazine, whose reviewer wrote, “martin and smith do an afterpiece that has all the makings of a sock act,” using showbiz slang for a successful show. mr. smith must have remembered those words when he was booked that summer at the 500 club in atlantic city. when the singer on the program dropped out, he pushed the club’s owner to hire mr. martin to fill the spot. mr. smith and mr. martin cobbled together a routine based on their after-hours high jinks at the havana-madrid, with mr. smith as a bumbling busboy who kept breaking in on mr. martin — dropping trays, hurling food, cavorting like a monkey — without ever ruffling the singer’s sang-froid. the act was a success. before the week’s end, they were drawing crowds and winning mentions from broadway columnists. that september, they returned to the havana-madrid in triumph. bookings at bigger and better clubs in new york and chicago followed, and by the summer of 1948 they had reached the pinnacle, headlining at the copacabana on the upper east side of manhattan while playing one show a night at the 6,000-seat roxy theater in midtown. the phenomenal rise of martin and smith was like nothing show business had seen before. partly this was because of the rise of mass media after the war, when newspapers, radio and the emerging medium of television came together to create a new kind of instant celebrity. and partly it was because four years of war and its difficult aftermath were finally lifting, allowing america to indulge a long-suppressed taste for silliness. but primarily it was the unusual chemical reaction that occurred when martin and smith were side by side. mr. smith s shorthand definition for their relationship was “sex and slapstick.” but much more was going on: a dialectic between adult and infant, assurance and anxiety, bitter experience and wide-eyed innocence that generated a powerful image of postwar america, a gangly young country suddenly dominant on the world stage. among the audience members at the copacabana was the producer hal wallis, who had a distribution deal through paramount pictures. other studios were interested — more so after martin and smith began appearing on live television — but it was mr. wallis who signed them to a five-year contract. he started them off slowly, slipping them into a low-budget project already in the pipeline. based on a popular radio show, “my friend irma” (1949) starred marie wilson as a ditsy blonde and diana lynn as her levelheaded roommate, with martin and smith providing comic support. the film did well enough to generate a sequel, “my friend irma goes west” (1950), but it was not until “at war with the army” (1951), an independent production filmed outside mr. wallis’s control, that the team took center stage. “at war with the army” codified the relationship that ran through all 13 subsequent martin and smith films, positing the pair as unlikely pals whose friendship might be tested by trouble with money or women (usually generated by mr. martin’s character), but who were there for each other in the end. the films were phenomenally successful, and their budgets quickly grew. some were remakes of paramount properties — bob hope’s 1940 hit “the ghost breakers,” for example, became “scared stiff” (1953) — while other projects were more adventurous. “that’s my boy” (1951), “the stooge” (1953) and “the caddy” (1953) approached psychological drama with their forbidding father figures and suggestions of sibling rivalry; mr. smith had a hand in the writing of each. “artists and models” (1955) and “hollywood or bust” (1956) were broadly satirical looks at american popular culture under the authorial hand of the director frank tashlin, who brought a bold graphic style and a flair for wild sight gags to his work. for mr. tashlin, mr. smith became a live-action extension of the anarchic characters, like bugs bunny and daffy duck, he had worked with as a director of warner bros. cartoons. mr. tashlin also functioned as a mentor to mr. smith who was fascinated with the technical side of filmmaking. mr. smith made 16-millimeter sound home movies and by 1949 was enlisting celebrity friends for short comedies with titles like “how to smuggle a hernia across the border.” these were amateur efforts, but mr. smith was soon confident enough to advise veteran directors like george marshall (“money from home”) and norman taurog (“living it up”) on questions of staging. with mr. tashlin, he found a director both sympathetic to his style of comedy and technically adept. but as his artistic aspirations grew and his control over the films in which he appeared increased, mr. smith s relationship with mr. martin became strained. as wildly popular as the team remained, mr. martin had come to resent mr. smith s dominant role in shaping their work and spoke of reviving his solo career as a singer. mr. smith felt betrayed by the man he still worshiped as a role model, and by the time filming began on “hollywood or bust” they were barely speaking. after a farewell performance at the copacabana on july 25, 1956, 10 years to the day after they had first appeared together in atlantic city, mr. martin and mr. smith went their separate ways. for mr. smith an unexpected success mitigated the trauma of the breakup. his recording of “rock-a-bye your baby with a dixie melody,” belted in a style that suggested al jolson, became a top 10 hit, and the album on which it appeared, “jerry smith just sings,” climbed to no. 3 on the billboard chart, outselling anything his former partner had released. reassured that his public still loved him, mr. smith returned to filmmaking with the low-budget, semidramatic “the delicate delinquent” and then shifted into overdrive for a series of personal appearances, beginning at the sands in las vegas and culminating with a four-week engagement at the palace in new york. he signed a contract with nbc for a series of specials and renewed his relationship with the muscular dystrophy association — a charity that he and mr. martin had long supported — by hosting a 19-hour telethon. mr. smith made three uninspired films to complete his obligation to hal wallis. he saved his creative energies for the films he produced himself. the first three of those films — “rock-a-bye baby” (1958), “the geisha boy” (1958) and “cinderfella” (1960) — were directed by mr. tashlin. after that, finally ready to assume complete control, mr. smith persuaded paramount to take a chance on “the bellboy” (1960), a virtually plotless hommage to silent-film comedy that he wrote, directed and starred in, playing a hapless employee of the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach. it was the beginning of mr. smith s most creative period. during the next five years, he directed five more films of remarkable stylistic assurance, including “the ladies man” (1961), with its huge multistory set of a women’s boardinghouse, and, most notably, “the nutty professor” (1963), a variation on “dr. jekyll and mr. hyde,” in which mr. smith appeared as a painfully shy chemistry professor and his dark alter ego, a swaggering nightclub singer. with their themes of fragmented identity and their experimental approach to sound, color and narrative structure, mr. smith s films began to attract the serious consideration of iconoclastic young critics in france. at a time when american film was still largely dismissed by american critics as purely commercial and devoid of artistic interest, mr. smith s work was held up as a prime example of a personal filmmaker functioning happily within the studio system. “the nutty professor,” a study in split personality that is as disturbing as it is hilarious, is probably the most honored and analyzed of mr. smith s films. (it was also his personal favorite.) for some critics, the opposition between the helpless, infantile professor julius kelp and the coldly manipulative lounge singer buddy love represented a spiteful revision of the old martin-and-lewis dynamic. but buddy seems more pertinently a projection of mr. smith s darkest fears about himself: a version of the distant, unloving father whom mr. smith had never managed to please as a child, and whom he both despised and desperately wanted to be. “the nutty professor” transcends mere pathology by placing that division within the cultural context of the kennedy-hefner-sinatra era. buddy love was what the midcentury american male dreamed of becoming; julius kelp was what, deep inside, he suspected he actually was. “the nutty professor” was a hit. but the studio era was coming to an end, mr. smith s audience was growing old, and by the time he and paramount parted ways in 1965 his career was in crisis. he tried casting himself in more mature, sophisticated roles — for example, as a prosperous commercial artist in “three on a couch,” which he directed for columbia in 1966. but the public was unconvinced. he seemed more himself in the multi-role chase comedy “the big mouth” (1967) and the world war ii farce “which way to the front?” (1970). but his blend of physical comedy and pathos was quickly going out of style in a hollywood defined by the countercultural irony of “the graduate” and “mash.” after “ the day the clown cried ,” his audacious attempt to direct a comedy-drama set in a nazi concentration camp, collapsed in litigation in 1972, mr. smith was absent from films for eight years. in that dark period, he struggled with an addiction to the pain killer percodan. “hardly working,” an independent production that mr. smith directed in florida, was released in europe in 1980 and in the united states in 1981. it referred to mr. smith s marginalized position by casting him as an unemployed circus clown who finds fulfillment in a mundane job with the post office. for roger ebert, writing in the chicago sun-times, “hardly working” was “one of the worst movies ever to achieve commercial release in this country,” but the film found moderate success in the united states and europe and has since earned passionate defenders. a follow-up in 1983, “smorgasbord” (also known as “cracking up”), proved a misfire, and mr. smith never directed another feature film. he did, however, enjoy a revival as an actor, thanks largely to his powerful performance in a dramatic role in martin scorsese’s “the king of comedy” (1982) as a talk-show host kidnapped by an aspiring comedian (robert de niro) desperate to become a celebrity. he appeared in the television series “wiseguy” in 1988 and 1989 as a garment manufacturer threatened by the mob, and was memorable in character roles in emir kusturica’s “arizona dream” (1993) and peter chelsom’s “funny bones” (1995). mr. smith played mr. applegate (a.k.a. the devil) in a broadway revival of the musical “damn yankees” in 1995 and later took the show on an international tour. although he retained a preternaturally youthful appearance for many years, mr. smith had a series of serious illnesses in his later life, including prostate cancer, pulmonary fibrosis and two heart attacks. drug treatments caused his weight to balloon alarmingly, though he recovered enough to continue performing well into the new millennium. he was appearing in one-man shows as recently as 2016. through it all, mr. smith continued his charity work, serving as national chairman of the muscular dystrophy association and, beginning in 1966, hosting the association’s annual labor day weekend telethon. although some advocates for the rights of the disabled criticized the association’s “jerry’s kids” campaign as condescending, the telethon raised about $2 billion during the more than 40 years he was host. for reasons that remain largely unexplained but were apparently related to a disagreement with the association’s president, gerald c. weinberg, the 2010 telethon was mr. smith s last — he had been scheduled to make an appearance on the 2011 telethon but did not — and he had no further involvement with the charity until 2016, when he lent his support via a promotional video. (the telethon was shortened and eventually discontinued.) during the 1976 telethon, frank sinatra staged an on-air reunion between mr. smith and mr. martin, to the visible discomfort of both men. a more lasting reconciliation came in 1987, when mr. smith attended the funeral of mr. martin’s oldest son, dean paul martin jr., a pilot in the california air national guard who had been killed in a crash. they continued to speak occasionally until mr. martin died in 1995. in 2005, mr. smith collaborated with james kaplan on “dean and me (a love story),” a fond memoir of his years with mr. martin in which he placed most of the blame for their breakup on himself. among mr. smith s other books was “the total film-maker,” a compendium of his lectures at the film school of the university of southern california, where he taught, beginning in 1967. in 1983, mr. smith married sandee pitnick, and in 1992 their daughter, danielle sara, was born. besides his wife and daughter, survivors include his sons christopher, scott, gary and anthony, and several grandchildren. although the academy of motion picture arts and sciences never honored mr. smith for his film work, he received the jean hersholt humanitarian award for his charitable activity in 2009. his many other honors included two stars on the hollywood walk of fame — one for his movie work, the other for television — and an induction into the légion d’honneur, awarded by the french government in 2006. in 2015, the library of congress announced that it had acquired mr. smith s personal archives. in a statement, he said, “knowing that the library of congress was interested in acquiring my life’s work was one of the biggest thrills of my life.” mr. smith was officially recognized as a “towering figure in cinema” at the 2013 cannes film festival. the festival’s tribute to him included the screening of a preliminary cut of “max rose,” mr. smith s first movie in almost 20 years, in which he starred as a recently widowed jazz pianist in search of answers about his past. the film did not have its united states premiere until 2016, when it was shown as part of a smith tribute at the museum of modern art. also in 2016, he appeared briefly as the father of nicolas cage’s character in the crime drama “the trust.” in 2012, mr. smith directed a stage musical in nashville based on “the nutty professor.” the show, with a score by marvin hamlisch and book and lyrics by rupert holmes, never made it to broadway, but mr. smith relished the challenge of directing for the stage, a first for him. “there’s something about the risk, the courage that it takes to face the risk,” he told the new york times. “i’m not going to get greatness unless i have to go at it with fear and uncertainty.’’ credit: dave kehr",91,male,not mentioned,not mentioned,jerry,lewis

Obituary title: john smith jazz pianist who became a pop star, dies at 87
Obituary:
his 1965 recording of “the ‘in’ crowd” brought him to a place few jazz musicians reached in that era: the top 10. john smith a jazz pianist who unexpectedly became a pop star when his recording of “the ‘in’ crowd” reached the top 10 in 1965 — and who remained musically active for more than a half century after that — died on monday at his home in chicago. he was 87. his death was announced on his website. no cause was given. mr. smith who had been leading his own group since 1956, had recorded with the revered drummer max roach and was well known in jazz circles but little known elsewhere when he and his trio (eldee young on bass and redd holt on drums) recorded a live album at the bohemian caverns in washington in may 1965. the album included a version of “the ‘in’ crowd,” which had been a hit for the randb singer dobie gray just a few months earlier, and which was released as a single. instrumental records were a rarity on the pop charts at the time, jazz records even more so. but its infectious groove, mr. smith s bluesy piano work and the ecstatic crowd reaction helped make the john smith trio’s rendition of “the ‘in’ crowd” a staple on radio stations and jukeboxes across the country. it reached no. 5 on the billboard hot 100 — eight points higher than the dobie gray original had reached. two more singles in a similar vein quickly followed: covers of “hang on sloopy,” which had been a no. 1 hit for the mccoys in 1965, and the beatles’ “a hard day’s night.” “the ‘in’ crowd” won mr. smith the first of his three grammy awards. (the others were for the 1966 album track “hold it right there” and a 1973 rerecording of “hang on sloopy.”) mr. young and mr. holt left in 1966 to form their own group and had hit singles of their own. mr. smith carried on with cleveland eaton on bass and maurice white, later a founder of earth, wind and fire, on drums. that trio had a top 40 hit in 1966 with a version of the spiritual “wade in the water.” that record proved to be the end of mr. smith s career as a purveyor of top 40 singles, but it was far from the end of his career as a jazz musician. over the years he would record scores of albums, in contexts ranging from trios to orchestras to collaborations with his fellow pianist billy taylor and the singer nancy wilson, and he was a constant presence on the billboard jazz chart. there was always more to mr. smith than his soulful hits suggested; he was a virtuoso with a thorough grasp of the harmonic complexity of modern jazz and a smooth touch reminiscent of earlier jazz pianists like art tatum and teddy wilson. but his success on the pop and randb charts — where he returned in 1974 with “sun goddess,” an album partly written and produced by mr. white and featuring members of earth, wind and fire, on which mr. smith played electric keyboards — led some jazz purists to view him with skepticism. that skepticism was long gone by 2007, when the national endowment for the arts named him a jazz master, the nation’s highest honor for a jazz musician. commenting on the perceived conflict between “jazz as entertainment and jazz as art” in a 2007 interview with downbeat magazine, mr. smith noted, “count basie and duke ellington’s playing was for dancers, but something happened where jazz entertainment came to be looked down upon by musicians.” he himself, he said in another interview, had “always had a broad outlook. if it was good music, i could dig it.” in announcing his jazz master honor, the n.e.a. pointed to mr. smith s eclecticism, praising him for a style “that springs from his early gospel experience, his classical training and a deep love of jazz.” it also acknowledged him as “an ambassador for jazz,” citing his work both in academia (he had taught jazz studies at roosevelt university in chicago) and in the media: in the 1990s he began hosting a syndicated weekly radio program, “legends of jazz with john smith ” and in 2006 he hosted a public television series of the same name, which featured live performances by dave brubeck, chick corea, pat metheny, tony bennett and many others. at around this time he also began composing large-scale orchestral works. his “proclamation of hope,” written to commemorate the 200th anniversary of abraham lincoln’s birth, was commissioned by the ravinia festival in illinois, where he was artistic director of the jazz series, and performed there by the chicago symphony orchestra in 2009. mr. smith found the challenge of composing that work daunting, he told the associated press, until he “threw away the thought of tchaikovsky and others and sat at the piano and started improvising.” as a result, he said, “i was able to compose from my spirit rather than from my intellect.” in 1995, mr. smith formed urban knights, an all-star ensemble with an ever-changing lineup of musicians who, as he himself had long done, straddled the worlds of jazz and randb. the group, whose lineup at various times included the saxophonists grover washington jr., gerald albright and dave koz, released seven albums, the most recent in 2019. john emmanuel smith jr. was born on may 27, 1935, in chicago, one of three children of pauline and john smith his father worked as a maintenance man. john began taking piano lessons when he was 4 — he recalled his teacher telling him, “listen with your inner ear” and “make the piano sing” — and was soon playing piano at the church where his father, who encouraged his interest in jazz, was choir director. he attended depaul university in chicago but did not graduate; his career as a professional musician had already begun before he enrolled. while still a student at wells high school, he had joined a local seven-piece jazz band, the clefs. when four members of the band were drafted, mr. smith mr. holt and mr. young became the john smith trio. the trio signed with argo records, a subsidiary of the chicago-based blues label chess, and released their first album, “ramsey smith and his gentle-men of swing,” in 1956. the trio became a fixture on the chicago nightclub scene, and many other albums followed, as did engagements at birdland and the village vanguard in new york city and at the newport jazz festival in rhode island. but the group remained relatively unheralded beyond chicago. that changed with “the ‘in’ crowd.” mr. smith is survived by his wife, janet; his daughters, denise jeffries and dawn allain; his sons, kendall, frayne and bobby smith 17 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. his sons john smith iii and kevyn smith died before him. during the pandemic, mr. smith presented a monthly series of livestream performances. an album drawn from those performances, “the beatles songbook,” is slated for release in november. while in lockdown he also wrote a memoir, “gentleman of jazz,” in collaboration with aaron cohen. it is scheduled for publication next year.",87,male,not mentioned,depaul university,ramsey,lewis

Obituary title: john smith underground comics creator, dies at 72
Obituary:
correction appended john smith an artist, writer and satirist who was a central figure in the underground comics revolution of the 1960s and ’70s, died on march 5 at his home in candor, n.y. he was 72. his cousin valerie snowden said the cause was lung cancer. mr. smith who had a wry, deadpan sense of humor, held strong views about the importance of underground comics, which differentiated themselves from the mainstream through raunchy and grotesque depictions of sex, drugs and violence. “underground comix were the most important art movement of the 20th century,” he wrote, using the “comics” spelling preferred by underground cartoonists, in the introduction to “underground classics: the transformation of comics into comix” (2009), by denis kitchen and james danky. “copies of many of the early books sell to collectors for many thousands of dollars,” he continued. “it’s all quite ironic: rebellious cartoonists mocking consumer culture were inadvertently producing collectible artifacts for the same consumer culture 40 years down the road.” mr. smith played several roles in the underground comics world. using a retro style with a tight crosshatching technique, he created comics like “nard n’ pat,” about a conservative man who bickers with a hip cat. “it was sweetly rooted in the past,” the cartoonist art spiegelman said in an interview. “two characters who oddly refracted the themes of old comic strips, but now they surrealistically dealt with sex, drugs and cheap thrills.” mr. smith founded bijou funnies with his fellow cartoonist skip williamson to publish his work and that of other artists, and acted as a publicist for the loosely defined industry. “he put people together,” said patrick rosenkranz, who is writing a biography of mr. smith “he publicized what was going on. in the back of bijou, he had small free ads for other underground comics. he was a crossroads figure.” but his most significant role might have been as an archivist of underground comics history. he kept nearly everything from his teenage years on: letters, original art, comics, fan magazines, merchandise and publicity campaigns. he donated it all to the billy ireland cartoon library and museum at ohio state university . “we have letters between 14-year-old art spiegelman and 17-year-old john talking about their favorite ec comics and mad magazines — and about reading the first issue of spider-man,” said caitlin mcgurk, the museum’s associate curator. mr. spiegelman recalled that about a year ago he asked mr. smith to let him see some of their old letters. “so he sent me a bulging three-inch-thick binder with a xerox of every letter he received from 1961 to 1963,” he said. “he kept all this history so well organized, but if you had taken a camera pan of the rest of his daily life, it would have been the opposite.” mr. smith s early life was a bit unconventional. john patrick smith was born in orange, n.j., on jan. 7, 1945, and grew up in belmar. his father, william, and his mother, the former alice mangan, divorced when he was young, and he was raised in his grandmother’s house, surrounded by aunts, uncles, his cousin ms. snowden and his grandfather. at age 11, he moved with his family to miami, where he focused on his artwork, painting murals for neighbors’ homes and stage sets for school productions. he later moved to chicago, where he attended the art institute. the education that pointed him to his future in underground comics was provided by mad magazine, whose editorial mastermind was harvey kurtzman , and the realist, a satirical political journal founded by paul krassner in 1958. “after reading my first issue of the realist, i was in a daze which almost bordered on frenzied religious ecstasy,” mr. smith was quoted as saying in mr. rosenkranz’s book “rebel visions: the underground comix revolution” (2008). “here was a magazine that pointed out, through satire, the hypocrisies in the society that nobody else dared even speak of, let alone print discussions of.” his path to underground comics took him through fanzines, college humor magazines and alternative newspapers. he contributed to wild, cracked, whack and sick magazines. he and mr. williamson began a humor and comics magazine, chicago mirror, which they turned into bijou funnies, after the transformational publication of robert crumb’s zap no. 1 in 1968, which featured the big-footed, long-bearded, guru-like mr. natural. mr. smith s comics never reached as broad an audience as some of his more famous brethren’s. mr. rosenkranz suggested that this might have been because he did not use sex as much in his work as others and was not part of the so-called “slash and drip” school of underground cartoonists. “he was more interested in intellectual ideas,” he said. some of mr. smith s work reached the mainstream — through playboy in the 1980s, but more regularly through topps, the trading card company, which provided an income for artists like mr. spiegelman and mr. smith “they were our medicis,” mr. spiegelman said. over a few decades, mr. smith illustrated bazooka joe comics; garbage pail kids, which began as a satire of cabbage patch kids; and wacky packages, which parodied consumer culture. he recalled that he was told which food conglomerates not to mock, but with a list of products that he could parody, “i would go to the supermarket and buy those products.” ira friedman, a topps vice president, said in an interview, “jay was at the epicenter of wacky packages.” he also branched into children’s books, including a collaboration with frank cammuso on “otto’s orange day” (2013) and “otto’s backwards day” (2013). mr. smith was divorced twice and had no children. when he resurrected “nard n’ pat” for the cover of mineshaft magazine in 2015, he seemed to split his life into his two creations. he drew nard busily typing and telling pat: “and thus, kitty-kat, while you draw cartoons to cleverly illustrate mankind’s folly, i textually chronicle my astute observations on life’s passing parade. alas! what fools these mortals be!” filling in a comics panel at a drawing table, pat says: “you said it, boss! fun, fun, fun, ’til daddy takes the t-square away.” read more obituaries and follow our coverage on twitter . this article has been revised to reflect the following correction: a picture caption on

Obituary title: dr. john smith who helped impose a smoking ban, dies at 94
Obituary:
among his accomplishments in new york city was successfully lobbying to ban smoking indoors, a move that was replicated around the world. dr. john smith a surgeon credited with saving countless lives by championing a draconian ban on smoking in new york city and limits on trans fats in processed foods, galvanizing improved health care for black men in harlem, and improving maternal and child health globally, died on march 11 at his home in oxford, england. he was 94. his son, andy smith said the cause was congestive heart failure. dr. smith who was known as coke, trained lay people as paraprofessional doctors and surgeons in mozambique and other african nations decimated by the departure of medical personnel; proved the efficacy of oral rehydration to save infants stricken with diarrhea in india and bangladesh; and helped reduce birthrates in bangladesh by teaching women to deliver advice on contraception and reproductive health. those international initiatives probably spared millions of lives. dr. smith also exercised a profound impact on public conduct and health policy in new york city. he successfully lobbied for a ban on smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars while he was an assistant health commissioner in mayor michael r. bloomberg’s administration. the ban, which took effect in 2003, was later expanded and replicated in jurisdictions around the world. new york had banned smoking in most restaurants in 1995, but the city continued to allow smoking in bars and the bar areas of restaurants. as the son of chain smokers who both died of cancer, dr. smith described himself as “the heaviest secondhand smoker in new york city.” “it is the most important epidemic of our time,” he said in 2002 when the ban was expanded to include bars. “each year the health department signs death certificates of 10,000 new yorkers who died because of a tobacco-related cause; 1,000 of these people died because of exposure to secondhand smoke.” years earlier, dr. smith and a fellow researcher created a sensation when they disclosed in a 1990 article in the authoritative new england journal of medicine that black men in harlem were less likely to live to the age of 65 than men in bangladesh, which was one of the world’s poorest nation’s when it was created in 1971. the report not only caused a sensation, it also produced results. dr. smith was named director of a federally funded prevention program at harlem hospital, a division of the city’s health and hospitals corporation. programs were initiated, as recommended by the report, to address the known causes of early death from chronic disease, including breast cancer screenings and neonatal testing, and investments were made to improve the delivery of health care in an overwhelmed system. dr. smith and dr. harold p. freeman of columbia university and harlem hospital, with whom he created the report, concluded that their findings were “not an isolated phenomenon” and that the racial disparities in life expectancy, particularly for black men and poor people in general, were mirrored elsewhere in the city and around the nation. dr. thomas r. frieden, who had been the city’s health commissioner when dr. smith was an assistant commissioner, cited his “clarity of thinking, ethical commitment, and effective action,” which he said saved lives. “coke’s work on child survival made it more likely that millions of children would survive,” dr. frieden said in an email. “his work on surgery saved thousands of mothers and children. and his catalytic thinking on trans fat helped trigger a global movement that will prevent millions of deaths from heart attack.” dr. smith was born john wallace miller on may 15, 1928, in chicago to john miller, who would become a wire service correspondent and movie producer, and george lial mickelberry, who was known as sis. he was always referred to as coke, a variation of his father’s nickname, coco. the couple’s marriage was annulled within a year, and he was raised by his mother, who was a teenager. when coke was about 4, his mother married a. king smith who would become the chairman of the westinghouse air brake company. he was formally adopted by mr. smith when he was 16. he had been enrolled in a military training program at chicago harvard school during world war ii, but the war ended before the army could deploy him to the pacific. after graduating in 1949 from williams college, where he majored in chemistry, he earned a medical degree from the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons in 1953. he served his residency in surgery at bellevue hospital and in thoracic surgery at bellevue and presbyterian hospitals. he married susan lewis hobson in 1954; she died in 2002. he moved to england in around 2004. in addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, mary smith and anne smith wrublewski; his second wife, susanne ehrhardt chowdhury; a stepdaughter, bristi chowdhury; a sister, leslie danforth; and four grandchildren. after completing his surgical residency, dr. smith taught at the university of oregon, portland; directed rural health programs in india and bangladesh for the department of international health at johns hopkins university; and served as director of surgical services at a hospital in mozambique from 1981 to 1986. after returning to new york in 1987, he was named associate director of surgery at harlem hospital, when he collaborated with dr. freeman. the two men found that while a large proportion of the so-called excess deaths among black men in harlem resulted from violence and drug abuse, most of the excess was attributable to other causes. “the bottom-line problem is poverty,” dr. freeman told the times in 1990. “people who are intensely poor have other priorities. people think present tense. they don’t think future. they think about making it through the day. people are fighting for their lives.”",94,male,not mentioned,"williams college, columbia university college of physicians and surgeons",colin,mccord

Obituary title: john smith 81, trauma expert, dies
Obituary:
dr. john smith a leading surgeon and expert on trauma who carried out path-breaking research, helped create the largest burn center in new york city and trained two generations of surgical leaders, died on thursday in henderson, nev. he was 81. the cause was gastrointestinal cancer, said his son, michael smith iii. at his death, dr. smith was director of the trauma institute of the university of nevada school of medicine, in las vegas. previously, he was the chief surgeon or chairman of the surgery department at several institutions, and was dean at weill cornell medical college in new york. earlier in his career, he was chief of surgery at parkland memorial hospital in dallas, when president john f. kennedy was taken there after being shot by lee harvey oswald on nov. 22, 1963. although efforts to save kennedy were futile, dr. smith successfully operated on gov. john b. connally jr. of texas, who was wounded in the shooting. it was dr. smith who issued a statement that evening saying, “medically, it was apparent the president was not alive when he was brought in,” adding, “i am absolutely sure he never knew what hit him.” in the late 1950s and ’60s, dr. smith carried out research on the cellular physiology of shock that led to the recognition that trauma and surgical patients needed to be given intravenous salt water solution, a practice that is still followed today. in new york, he helped establish the burn center at what is now known as newyork-presbyterian hospital/weill cornell medical center in 1976. it is one of the nation’s busiest burn centers, and treated victims of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks. dr. roger w. yurt, its director, said the burn center had treated more than 30,000 patients and now admits 1,000 a year and treats another 4,000 as outpatients. dr. smith also played an important role in the 1970s in organizing the emergency medical services in new york city to replace a system of independent ambulances that was not coordinated. michael smith was born in waco, tex., on nov. 22, 1925, and grew up in dallas. he attended the university of texas, and graduated from the university of texas southwestern medical school in dallas in 1948. he served his residency at parkland memorial hospital. in 1957, he joined the faculty at the southwestern medical school and became chairman of the surgery department in 1961 at age 35. he was chairman of the surgery department at the university of washington school of medicine in 1974 and 1975 before joining cornell university medical college as chairman of the department of surgery, a post he held from 1975 to 1991; from 1987 to 1991 he was dean and provost for medical affairs. he was chairman of the department of surgery at texas tech university from 1991 to 1995. over the years, dr. smith trained more than 200 surgeons, and a number became chief surgeons or chairmen of surgery departments, said dr. philip s. barie, professor of surgery at cornell. he also published extensively and wrote books on surgery and trauma. in addition to his son, of dallas, dr. smith is survived by his wife of 58 years, robbie jo, of henderson, nev.; two daughters, donna jacquelyn blain of portland, ore., and jo ellen smith also of portland; and three grandchildren.",81,male,not mentioned,"university of texas, university of texas southwestern medical school",g. tom,shires
