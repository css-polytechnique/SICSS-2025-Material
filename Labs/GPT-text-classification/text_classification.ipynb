    "> OpenRouter is a unified API that allows developers to access and use a wide range of powerful language models—such as OpenAI's GPT, Claude, Mistral, and others—without having to host them locally.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Instead of installing and running large models on your own hardware, OpenRouter provides a simple interface to purchase and perform inference via third-party providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "> OpenRouter acts as an intermediary that routes your model requests (inference) to a variety of model providers, depending on your selection. You simply send API requests through a single endpoint, and OpenRouter handles:\n",
    ">- Model selection (unless you specify)\n",
    ">- Authentication\n",
    ">- Billing\n",
    ">- Request routing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use OpenRouter Instead of Running Models Locally?**\n",
    "> Running generative large-scale models (Llama, Claude 3, etc.) locally is challenging due to: hardware limitations (GPUs), storage requirements (memory), setup complexity.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Using OpenRouter offers several key advantages:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- No need for expensive local GPUs or cloud infrastructure.\n",
    ">- Immediate access to multiple top-tier models.\n",
    ">- Easy integration with just a few lines of code.\n",
    ">- Pay-as-you-go pricing based on usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it with Python, we can use the OpenAPI wrapper + a key with credit:\n",
    "https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to use Open Router is shared with a `.txt` file. Prepare the config file that is shared on the drive, together with this notebook.\n",
